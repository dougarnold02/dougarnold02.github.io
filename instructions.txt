To add a bib entry:
   - edit the relevant bit of index.tex, if the entry's citation key is Arnold2020xxx
   - make sure it is in Arnold-major.bib or Arnold-minor.bib
   - add the entry in a single file to bib/Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt
     - cd bib
     - make Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt
     - make all
     - cd -
   - now run 
     - make latex  (this will set things up for the run of make bib)
     - make bib
     - make
     - make view
   - if you do not have privatewww directly mounted, then do 
     - make sync-put

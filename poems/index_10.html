<strong>In Paris with You</strong><BR><em>James Fenton</em>
<BR>
<BR> Don't talk to me of love.  I've had an earful
<BR> And I get tearful when I've downed a drink or two.
<BR> I'm one of your talking wounded.
<BR> I'm a hostage. I'm maroonded.
<BR> But I'm in Paris with you.<br><BR> 
<BR> Yes, I'm angry at the way I've been bamboozled
<BR> And resentful at the mess that I've been through.
<BR> I admit I'm on the rebound
<BR> And I don't care where are we bound.
<BR> I'm in Paris with you.<br><BR> 
<BR> Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre,
<BR> If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame
<BR> If we skip the champs Elysees
<BR> And remain here in this sleazy
<BR> Old hotel room
<BR> Doing this or that
<BR> To what and whom
<BR> Learning who you are,
<BR> Learning what I am.<br><BR> 
<BR> Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris,
<BR> The little bit of Paris in our view.
<BR> There's that crack across the ceiling
<BR> And the hotel walls are peeling 
<BR> And I'm in Paris with you.<br><BR> 
<BR> Don't talk to me of love.  Let's talk of Paris.
<BR> I'm in Paris with the slightest thing you do.
<BR> I'm in Paris with your eyes, your mouth,
<BR> I'm in Paris with ...all points south.
<BR> Am I embarrassing you?
<BR> I'm in Paris with you.<br><BR> 
 <strong>Out of the East</strong><BR><em>James Fenton</em>
<BR>
<BR> Out of the South came Famine.
<BR> Out of the West came Strife.
<BR> Out of the North came a storm cone
<BR> And out of the East came a warrior wind
<BR> And it struck you like a knife.
<BR> Out of the East there shone a sun
<BR> As the blood rose on the day
<BR> And it shone on the work of the warrior wind
<BR> And it shone on the heart
<BR> And it shone on the soul
<BR> And they called the sun -- Dismay.<br><BR> 
<BR> And it's a far cry from the jungle
<BR> To the city of Phnom Penh
<BR> And many try
<BR> And many die
<BR> Before they can see their homes again
<BR> And it's a far cry from the paddy track
<BR> To the palace of the king
<BR> And many go
<BR> Before they know
<BR> It's a far cry.
<BR> It's a war cry.
<BR> Cry for the war that can do this thing.<br><BR> 
<BR> A foreign soldier came to me
<BR> And he gave me a gun
<BR> And he predicted victory
<BR> Before the year was done.<br><BR> 
<BR> He taught me how to kill a man.
<BR> He taught me how to try.
<BR> Be he forgot to say to me
<BR> How an honest man should die.<br><BR> 
<BR> He taught me how to kill a man
<BR> Who was my enemy
<BR> But never how to kill a man
<BR> Who'd been a friend to me.<br><BR> 
<BR> You fought the way a hero fights --
<BR> You had no need to fear
<BR> My friend, but you are wounded now
<BR> And I'm not allowed to leave you here<br><BR> 
<BR> Alive.<br><BR> 
<BR> Out of the East came Anger
<BR> And it walked a dusty road
<BR> And it stopped when it came to a river bank
<BR> And it pitched a camp
<BR> And it gazed across
<BR> To where the city stood
<BR> When
<BR> Out of the West came thunder
<BR> But it came without a sound
<BR> For it came at the speed of the warrior wind
<BR> And it fell on the heart
<BR> And it fell on the soul
<BR> And it shook the battleground<br><BR> 
<BR> And it's a far cry from the cockpit
<BR> To the foxhole in the clay
<BR> And we were a
<BR> Coordinate
<BR> In a foreign land
<BR> Far away
<BR> And it's a far cry from the paddy track
<BR> To the palace of the king
<BR> And many try
<BR> And they ask why
<BR> It's a far cry.
<BR> It's a war cry.
<BR> Cry for the war that can do this thing.<br><BR> 
<BR> Next year the army came for me
<BR> And I was sick and thin
<BR> And they put a weapon in our hands
<BR> And they told us we would win<br><BR> 
<BR> And they feasted us for seven days
<BR> And they slaughtered a hundred cattle
<BR> And we sang our songs of victory
<BR> And the glory of the battle<br><BR> 
<BR> And they sent us down the dusty roads
<BR> In the stillness of the night
<BR> And when the city heard from us
<BR> It burst in a flower of light.<br><BR> 
<BR> The tracer bullets found us out.
<BR> The guns were never wrong
<BR> And the gunship said Regret Regret
<BR> The words of your victory song.<br><BR> 
<BR> Out of the North came an army
<BR> And it was clad in black
<BR> And out of the South came a gun crew
<BR> With a hundred shells
<BR> And a howitzer
<BR> And we walked in black along the paddy track
<BR> When
<BR> Out of the West came napalm
<BR> And it tumbled from the blue
<BR> And it spread at the speed of the warrior wind
<BR> And it clung to the heart
<BR> And it clung to the soul
<BR> As napalm is designed to do<br><BR> 
<BR> And it's a far cry from the fireside
<BR> To the fire that finds you there
<BR> In the foxhole
<BR> By the temple gate
<BR> The fire that finds you everywhere
<BR> And it's a far cry from the paddy track
<BR> To the palace of the king
<BR> And many try
<BR> And they ask why
<BR> It's a far cry.
<BR> It's a war cry.
<BR> Cry for the war that can do this thing.<br><BR> 
<BR> My third year in the army
<BR> I was sixteen years old
<BR> And I had learnt enough, my friend,
<BR> To believe what I was told<br><BR> 
<BR> And I was told that we would take
<BR> The city of Phnom Penh
<BR> And they slaughtered all the cows we had
<BR> And they feasted us again<br><BR> 
<BR> And at last we were given river mines
<BR> And we blocked the great Mekong
<BR> And now we trained our rockets on
<BR> The landing-strip at Pochentong.<br><BR> 
<BR> The city lay within our grasp.
<BR> We only had to wait.
<BR> We only had to hold the line
<BR> By the foxhole, by the temple gate<br><BR> 
<BR> When
<BR> Out of the West came clusterbombs
<BR> And they burst in a hundred shards
<BR> And every shard was a new bomb
<BR> And it burst again
<BR> Upon our men
<BR> As they gasped for breath in the temple yard.
<BR> Out of the West came a new bomb
<BR> And it sucked away the air
<BR> And it sucked at the heart
<BR> And it sucked at the soul
<BR> And it found a lot of children there<br><BR> 
<BR> And it's a far cry from the temple yard
<BR> To the map of the general staff
<BR>  From the grease pen to the gasping men
<BR> To the wind that blows the soul like chaff
<BR> And it's a far cry from the paddy track
<BR> To the palace of the king
<BR> And many go
<BR> Before they know
<BR> It's a far cry.
<BR> It's a war cry.
<BR> Cry for the war that has done this thing.<br><BR> 
<BR> A foreign soldier came to me
<BR> And he gave me a gun
<BR> And the liar spoke of victory
<BR> Before the year was done.<br><BR> 
<BR> What would I want with victory
<BR> In the city of Phnom Penh?
<BR> Punish the city! Punish the people!
<BR> What would I want but punishment?<br><BR> 
<BR> We have brought the king home to his palace.
<BR> We shall leave him there to weep
<BR> And we'll go back along the paddy track
<BR> For we have promises to keep.<br><BR> 
<BR> For the promise made in the foxhole,
<BR> For the oath in the temple yard,
<BR> For the friend I killed on the battlefield
<BR> I shall make that punishment hard.<br><BR> 
<BR> Out of the South came Famine.
<BR> Out of the West came Strife.
<BR> Out of the North came a storm cone
<BR> And out of the East came a warrior wind
<BR> And it struck you like a knife.
<BR> Out of the East there shone a sun
<BR> As the blood rose on the day
<BR> And it shone on the work of the warrior wind
<BR> And it shone on the heart
<BR> And it shone on the soul
<BR> And they called the sun Dismay, my friend,
<BR> They called the sun -- Dismay.<br><BR>
<BR>
<p><strong>The Ballad of the Imam and the Shah</strong><BR><em>James Fenton</em>
<BR>(An Old Persian Legend)
<BR>to C. E. H.<br><BR>
<BR> It started with a stabbing at a well
<BR> Below the minarets of Isfahan.
<BR> The widow took her son to see them kill
<BR> The officer who'd murdered her old man.
<BR> The child looked up and saw the hangman's work --
<BR> The man who'd killed his father swinging high,
<BR> The mother said: 'My child, now be at peace.
<BR> The wolf has had the fruits of all his crime.'<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From felony to felony to crime
<BR>  From robbery to robbery to loss
<BR>  From calumny to calumny to spite
<BR>  From rivalry to rivalry to zeal</i><br><BR>
<BR> All this was many centuries ago --
<BR> The kind of thing that couldn't happen now --
<BR> When Persia was the empire of the Shah
<BR> And many were the furrows on his brow.
<BR> The peacock the symbol of his throne
<BR> And many were the jewels and its eyes
<BR> And many were the prisons in the land
<BR> And many were the torturers and spies.<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From tyranny to tyranny to war
<BR>  From dynasty to dynasty to hate
<BR>  From villainy to villainy to death
<BR>  From policy to policy to grave</i><br><BR>
<BR> The child grew up a clever sort of chap
<BR> And he became a mullah, like his dad --
<BR> Spent many years in exile and disgrace
<BR> Because he told the world the Shah was bad.
<BR> 'Believe in God,' he said, 'believe in me.
<BR> Believe me when I tell you who I am.
<BR> Now chop the arm of wickedness away.
<BR> Hear what I say, I am the great Imam.'<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From heresy to heresy to fire
<BR>  From clerisy to clerisy to fear
<BR>  From litany to litany to sword
<BR>  From fallacy to fallacy to wrong</i><br><BR>
<BR> And so the Shah was forced to flee abroad.
<BR> The Imam was the ruler in his place.
<BR> He started killing everyone he could
<BR> To make up for the years of his discgrace.
<BR> And when there were no enemies at home
<BR> He sent his men to Babylon to fight.
<BR> And when he'd lost an army in that way
<BR> He knew what God was telling him was right.<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From poverty to poverty to wrath
<BR>  From agony to agony to doubt
<BR>  From malady to malady to shame
<BR>  From misery to misery to fight</i><br><BR>
<BR> He sent the little children out to war.
<BR> They went out with his portrait in their hands.
<BR> The desert and the marshes filled with blood.
<BR> The mothers heard the news in Isfahan.
<BR> Now Babylon is buried under dirt.
<BR> Persepolis is peeping through the sand.
<BR> The child who saw his father's killer killed
<BR> Has slaughtered half the children in the land.<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR> From felony
<BR> to robbery
<BR> to calumny
<BR> to rivalry
<BR> to tyranny
<BR> to dynasty
<BR> to villainy
<BR> to policy
<BR> to heresy
<BR> to clerisy
<BR> to litany
<BR> to fallacy
<BR> to poverty
<BR> to agony
<BR> to malady
<BR> to misery --</i><br><BR>
<BR> The song is yours. Arrange it as you will.
<BR> Remember where each word fits in the line
<BR> And every combination will be true
<BR> And every permutation will be fine:<br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From policy to felony to fear
<BR>  From litany to heresy to fire
<BR>  From villainy to tyranny to war
<BR>  From tyranny to dynasty to shame</i><br><BR>
<BR><i>
<BR>  From poverty to malady to grave
<BR>  From malady to agony to spite
<BR>  From agony to misery to hate
<BR>  From misery to policy to fight!</i><br><BR> 
<p> <strong>Out of Danger</strong><BR><em>James Fenton</em>
<BR> Heart be kind and sign the release
<BR> As the trees their loss approve.
<BR> Learn as leaves must learn to fall
<BR> Out of danger, out of love.<br><BR>   
<BR> What belongs to frost and thaw
<BR> Sullen winter will not harm.
<BR> What belongs to wind and rain
<BR> Is out of danger from the storm.<br><BR>   
<BR> Jealous passion, cruel need
<BR> Betray the heart they feed upon.
<BR> But what belongs to earth and death
<BR> Is out of danger from the sun.<br><BR>   
<BR> I was cruel, I was wrong --
<BR> Hard to say and hard to know.
<BR> You do not belong to me.
<BR> You are out of danger now --<br><BR>   
<BR> Out of danger from the wind,
<BR> Out of danger from the wave,
<BR> Out of danger from the heart
<BR> Falling, falling out of love.<br><BR> 
<BR>
<strong>For Andrew Wood</strong><BR><em>James Fenton</em>
<BR>What would the dead want from us
<BR>Watching from their cave?
<BR>Would they have us forever howling?
<BR>Would they have us rave
<BR>Or disfigure ourselves, or be strangled
<BR>Like some ancient emperor’s slave?<br><BR>
<BR>None of my dead friends were emperors
<BR>With such exorbitant tastes
<BR>And none of them were so vengeful
<BR>As to have all their friends waste
<BR>Waste quiet away in sorrow
<BR>Disfigured and defaced.<br><BR>
<BR>I think the dead would want us
<BR>To weep for what they have lost.
<BR>I think that our luck in continuing
<BR>Is what would affect them most.
<BR>But time would find them generous
<BR>And less self-engrossed.<br><BR>
<BR>And time would find them generous
<BR>As they used to be
<BR>And what else would they want from us
<BR>But an honored place in our memory,
<BR>A favorite room, a hallowed chair,
<BR>Privilege and celebrity?
<BR>And so the dead might cease to grieve
<BR>And we might make amends
<BR>And there might be a pact between
<BR>Dead friends and living friends.
<BR>What our dead friends would want from us
<BR>Would be such living friends.<br><BR>

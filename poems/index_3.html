<h1>Robert Frost</h1>
<strong>After Apple Picking</strong><BR><em>Robert Frost</em>
<BR>     My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree 
<BR>     Toward heaven still. 				  
<BR>     And there's a barrel that I didn't fill 		  
<BR>     Beside it, and there may be two or three 		  
<BR>     Apples I didn't pick upon some bough. 		  
<BR>     But I am done with apple-picking now. 		  
<BR>     Essence of winter sleep is on the night, 		  
<BR>     The scent of apples; I am drowsing off. 		  
<BR>     I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight 		  
<BR>     I got from looking through a pane of glass 	  
<BR>     I skimmed this morning from the water-trough, 	  
<BR>     And held against the world of hoary grass. 	  
<BR>     It melted, and I let it fall and break. 		  
<BR>     But I was well 					  
<BR>     Upon my way to sleep before it fell, 		  
<BR>     And I could tell 					  
<BR>     What form my dreaming was about to take. 		  
<BR>     Magnified apples appear and reappear, 		  
<BR>     Stem end and blossom end, 				  
<BR>     And every fleck of russet showing clear. 		  
<BR>     My instep arch not only keeps the ache, 		  
<BR>     It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. 		  
<BR>     And I keep hearing from the cellar-bin 		  
<BR>     That rumbling sound 				  
<BR>     Of load on load of apples coming in. 		  
<BR>     For I have had too much 				  
<BR>     Of apple-picking; I am overtired 			  
<BR>     Of the great harvest I myself desired. 		  
<BR>     There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, 	  
<BR>     Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall, 	  
<BR>     For all 						  
<BR>     That struck the earth, 				  
<BR>     No matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble, 	  
<BR>     Went surely to the cider-apple heap 		  
<BR>     As of no worth. 					  
<BR>     One can see what will trouble 			  
<BR>     This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is. 		  
<BR>     Were he not gone, 					  
<BR>     The woodchuck could say whether it's like his 	  
<BR>     Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, 		  
<BR>     Or just some human sleep.                            
<BR>
<p><strong>Birches</strong><BR><em>Robert Frost</em>
<BR>
<BR>     When I see birches bend to left and right                    
<BR>     Across the lines of straighter darker trees, 		  
<BR>     I like to think some boy's been swinging them. 		  
<BR>     But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay. 		  
<BR>     Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them 		  
<BR>     Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning 			  
<BR>     After a rain. They click upon themselves 			  
<BR>     As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored 		  
<BR>     As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. 		  
<BR>     Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells 	  
<BR>     Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust- 		  
<BR>     Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away 			  
<BR>     You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. 		  
<BR>     They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, 	  
<BR>     And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed 	  
<BR>     So low for long, they never right themselves: 		  
<BR>     You may see their trunks arching in the woods 		  
<BR>     Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground 	  
<BR>     Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair 	  
<BR>     Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. 		  
<BR>     But I was going to say when Truth broke in 		  
<BR>     With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm 		  
<BR>     (Now am I free to be poetical?) 				  
<BR>     I should prefer to have some boy bend them 		  
<BR>     As he went out and in to fetch the cows- 			  
<BR>     Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, 		  
<BR>     Whose only play was what he found himself, 		  
<BR>     Summer or winter, and could play alone. 			  
<BR>     One by one he subdued his father's trees 			  
<BR>     By riding them down over and over again 			  
<BR>     Until he took the stiffness out of them, 			  
<BR>     And not one but hung limp, not one was left 		  
<BR>     For him to conquer. He learned all there was 		  
<BR>     To learn about not launching out too soon 			  
<BR>     And so not carrying the tree away 				  
<BR>     Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise 		  
<BR>     To the top branches, climbing carefully 			  
<BR>     With the same pains you use to fill a cup 			  
<BR>     Up to the brim, and even above the brim. 			  
<BR>     Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, 		  
<BR>     Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. 	  
<BR>     So was I once myself a swinger of birches. 		  
<BR>     And so I dream of going back to be. 			  
<BR>     It's when I'm weary of considerations, 			  
<BR>     And life is too much like a pathless wood 			  
<BR>     Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs 	  
<BR>     Broken across it, and one eye is weeping 			  
<BR>     From a twig's having lashed across it open. 		  
<BR>     I'd like to get away from earth awhile 			  
<BR>     And then come back to it and begin over. 			  
<BR>     May no fate willfully misunderstand me 			  
<BR>     And half grant what I wish and snatch me away 		  
<BR>     Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: 		  
<BR>     I don't know where it's likely to go better. 		  
<BR>     I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, 			  
<BR>     And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk 		  
<BR>     Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, 		  
<BR>     But dipped its top and set me down again. 			  
<BR>     That would be good both going and coming back. 		  
<BR>     One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.             
<BR>
<p><strong>Mending Wall </strong><BR><em>Robert Frost</em>
<BR>     Something there is that doesn't love a wall,                
<BR>     That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, 		 
<BR>     And spills the upper boulders in the sun, 			 
<BR>     And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 			 
<BR>     The work of hunters is another thing: 			 
<BR>     I have come after them and made repair 			 
<BR>     Where they have left not one stone on a stone, 		 
<BR>     But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 		 
<BR>     To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 		 
<BR>     No one has seen them made or heard them made, 		 
<BR>     But at spring mending-time we find them there. 		 
<BR>     I let my neighbort know beyond the hill; 			 
<BR>     And on a day we meet to walk the line 			 
<BR>     And set the wall between us once again. 			 
<BR>     We keep the wall between us as we go. 			 
<BR>     To each the boulders that have fallen to each. 		 
<BR>     And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 		 
<BR>     We have to use a spell to make them balance: 		 
<BR>     `Stay where you are until our backs are turned!' 		 
<BR>     We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 		 
<BR>     Oh, just another kind of out-door game, 			 
<BR>     One on a side. It comes to little more: 			 
<BR>     There where it is we do not need the wall: 		 
<BR>     He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 			 
<BR>     My apple trees will never get across 			 
<BR>     And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. 		 
<BR>     He only says, `Good fences make good neighhours'. 		 
<BR>     Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 		 
<BR>     If I could put a notion in his head: 			 
<BR>     `Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it 		 
<BR>     Where there are cows? 					 
<BR>     But here there are no cows. 				 
<BR>     Before I built a wall I'd ask to know 			 
<BR>     What I was walling in or walling out, 			 
<BR>     And to whom I was like to give offence. 			 
<BR>     Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 		 
<BR>     That wants it down.' I could say `.Elves' to him, 		 
<BR>     But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather 		 
<BR>     He said it for himself. I see him there 			 
<BR>     Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 		 
<BR>     In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 		 
<BR>     He moves in darkness as it seems to me ---		 
<BR>     Not of woods only and the shade of trees. 			 
<BR>     He will not go behind his father's saying, 		 
<BR>     And he likes having thought of it so well 			 
<BR>     He says again, Good fences make good neighbours.            
<BR>
<p><p><strong>On Looking Up by Chance at the Constellations</strong><BR><em>Robert Frost</em>
<BR>     You'll wait a long, long time for anything much                 
<BR>     To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud 		     
<BR>     And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves. 	     
<BR>     The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch, 	     
<BR>     Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud. 	     
<BR>     The planets seem to interfere in their curves -- 		     
<BR>     But nothing ever happens, no harm is done. 		     
<BR>     We may as well go patiently on with our life, 		     
<BR>     And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun 		     
<BR>     For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. 	     
<BR>     It is true the longest drout will end in rain, 		     
<BR>     The longest peace in China will end in strife. 		     
<BR>     Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake 	     
<BR>     In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break 		     
<BR>     On his particular time and personal sight. 		     
<BR>     That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.                
<BR>
<p><strong>Stopping in the Woods on a Snowy Evening</strong><BR><em>Robert Frost</em>
<BR>
<BR>     Whose woods these are I think I know  
<BR>     His house is in the village though;   
<BR>     He will not see me stopping here 	   
<BR>     To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br><BR>
<BR>     My little horse must think it queer 
<BR>     To stop without a farmhouse near 	 
<BR>     Between the woods and frozen lake 	 
<BR>     The darkest evening of the year.    <br><BR>
<BR>     He gives his harness bells a shake   
<BR>     To ask if there is some mistake. 	  
<BR>     The only other sound's the sweep 	  
<BR>     Of easy wind and downy flake.       <br><BR>
<BR>     The woods are lovely, dark and deep. 
<BR>     But I have promises to keep, 	  
<BR>     And miles to go before I sleep. 	  
<BR>     And miles to go before I sleep.

<strong>The Stare's Nest by My Window</strong><BR><em>W. B. Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR> The bees build in the crevices
<BR> Of loosening masonry, and there
<BR> The mother birds bring grubs and flies.
<BR> My wall is loosening; honey-bees,
<BR> Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br><BR> 
<BR> We are closed in, and the key is turned
<BR> On our uncertainty; somewhere
<BR> A man is killed, or a house burned.
<BR> Yet no clear fact to be discerned:
<BR> Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br><BR> 
<BR> A barricade of stone or of wood;
<BR> Some fourteen days of civil war:
<BR> Last night they trundled down the road
<BR> That dead young soldier in his blood:
<BR> Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br><BR> 
<BR> We had fed the heart on fantasies,
<BR> The heart's grown brutal from the fare,
<BR> More substance in our enmities
<BR> Than in our love; O honey-bees,
<BR> Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br><BR>
<BR>           ("Meditations in Time of Civil War - VI", 1928)

<p><strong>A Prayer For My Daughter</strong><BR><em>W.B.Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR> Once more the storm is howling, and half hid
<BR> Under this cradle-hood and coverlid
<BR> My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle
<BR> But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
<BR> Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,
<BR> Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
<BR> And for an hour I have walked and prayed
<BR> Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.<br><BR>
<BR> I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
<BR> And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
<BR> And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
<BR> In the elms above the flooded stream;
<BR> Imagining in excited reverie
<BR> That the future years had come,
<BR> Dancing to a frenzied drum,
<BR> Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.<br><BR>
<BR> May she be granted beauty and yet not
<BR> Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
<BR> Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
<BR> Being made beautiful overmuch,
<BR> Consider beauty a sufficient end,
<BR> Lose natural kindness and maybe
<BR> The heart-revealing intimacy
<BR> That chooses right, and never find a friend.<br><BR>
<BR> Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
<BR> And later had much trouble from a fool,
<BR> While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
<BR> Being fatherless could have her way
<BR> Yet chose a bandy-legg&egrave;d smith for man.
<BR> It's certain that fine women eat
<BR> A crazy salad with their meat
<BR> Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.<br><BR>
<BR> In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
<BR> Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
<BR> By those that are not entirely beautiful;
<BR> Yet many, that have played the fool
<BR> For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
<BR> And many a poor man that has roved,
<BR> Loved and thought himself beloved,
<BR> From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.<br><BR>
<BR> May she become a flourishing hidden tree
<BR> That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
<BR> And have no business but dispensing round
<BR> Their magnanimities of sound,
<BR> Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
<BR> Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
<BR> O may she live like some green laurel
<BR> Rooted in one dear perpetual place.<br><BR>
<BR> My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
<BR> The sort of beauty that I have approved,
<BR> Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
<BR> Yet knows that to be choked with hate
<BR> May well be of all evil chances chief.
<BR> If there's no hatred in a mind
<BR> Assault and battery of the wind
<BR> Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.<br><BR>
<BR> An intellectual hatred is the worst,
<BR> So let her think opinions are accursed.
<BR> Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
<BR> Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
<BR> Because of her opinionated mind
<BR> Barter that horn and every good
<BR> By quiet natures understood
<BR> For an old bellows full of angry wind?<br><BR>
<BR> Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
<BR> The soul recovers radical innocence
<BR> And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
<BR> Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
<BR> And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
<BR> She can, though every face should scowl
<BR> And every windy quarter howl
<BR> Or every bellows burst, be happy still.<br><BR>
<BR> And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
<BR> Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
<BR> For arrogance and hatred are the wares
<BR> Peddled in the thoroughfares.
<BR> How but in custom and in ceremony
<BR> Are innocence and beauty born?
<BR> Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
<BR> And custom for the spreading laurel tree.<br><BR>
<p><strong>The Second Coming</strong><BR><em>William Butler Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>Turning and turning in the widening gyre
<BR>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
<BR>Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;
<BR>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
<BR>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
<BR>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
<BR>The best lack all conviction, while the worst
<BR>Are full of passionate intensity.<br><BR>
<BR>Surely some revelation is at hand;
<BR>Surely the Second Coming is at hand:
<BR>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
<BR>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
<BR>Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert
<BR>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
<BR>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
<BR>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
<BR>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
<BR>The darkness drops again; but now I know
<BR>That twenty centuries of stony sleep
<BR>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
<BR>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
<BR>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
<BR>
<p><strong>Among School Children</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>I walk through the long schoolroom questioning;
<BR>A kind old nun in a white hood replies;
<BR>The children learn to cipher and to sing,
<BR>To study reading-books and histories,
<BR>To cut and sew, be neat in everything
<BR>In the best modern way - the children's eyes
<BR>In momentary wonder stare upon
<BR>A sixty-year-old smiling public man.<br><BR>
<BR>I dream of a Ledaean body, bent
<BR>Above a sinking fire. A tale that she
<BR>Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event
<BR>That changed some childish day to tragedy -
<BR>Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent
<BR>Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,
<BR>Or else, to alter Plato's parable,
<BR>Into the yolk and white of the one shell.<br><BR>
<BR>And thinking of that fit of grief or rage
<BR>I look upon one child or t'other there
<BR>And wonder if she stood so at that age -
<BR>For even daughters of the swan can share
<BR>Something of every paddler's heritage -
<BR>And had that colour upon cheek or hair,
<BR>And thereupon my heart is driven wild:
<BR>She stands before me as a living child.<br><BR>
<BR>Her present image floats into the mind -
<BR>Did Quattrocento finger fashion it
<BR>Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind
<BR>And took a mess of shadows for its meat?
<BR>And I though never of Ledaean kind
<BR>Had pretty plumage once - enough of that,
<BR>Better to smile on all that smile, and show
<BR>There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.<br><BR>
<BR>What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap
<BR>Honey of generation had betrayed,
<BR>And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
<BR>As recollection or the drug decide,
<BR>Would think her Son, did she but see that shape
<BR>With sixty or more winters on its head,
<BR>A compensation for the pang of his birth,
<BR>Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?<br><BR>
<BR>Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
<BR>Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
<BR>Solider Aristotle played the taws
<BR>Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
<BR>World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
<BR>Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
<BR>What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
<BR>Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.<br><BR>
<BR>Both nuns and mothers worship images,
<BR>But those the candles light are not as those
<BR>That animate a mother's reveries,
<BR>But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
<BR>And yet they too break hearts - O presences
<BR>That passion, piety or affection knows,
<BR>And that all heavenly glory symbolise -
<BR>O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;<br><BR>
<BR>Labour is blossoming or dancing where
<BR>The body is not bruised to pleasure soul.
<BR>Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
<BR>Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
<BR>O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer,
<BR>Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
<BR>O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
<BR>How can we know the dancer from the dance? <br><BR>
<p> 
<strong>The Wild Swans at Coole</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>The trees are in their autumn beauty, 
<BR>The woodland paths are dry, 
<BR>Under the October twilight the water 
<BR>Mirrors a still sky; 
<BR>Upon the brimming water among the stones 
<BR>Are nine and fifty swans. <br><BR>
<BR>The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me 
<BR>Since I first made my count; 
<BR>I saw, before I had well finished, 
<BR>All suddenly mount 
<BR>And scatter wheeling in great broken rings 
<BR>Upon their clamorous wings. <br><BR>
<BR>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures, 
<BR>And now my heart is sore. 
<BR>All's changed since I, hearing at twilight, 
<BR>The first time on this shore, 
<BR>The bell-beat of their wings above my head, 
<BR>Trod with a lighter tread. <br><BR>
<BR>Unwearied still, lover by lover, 
<BR>They paddle in the cold, 
<BR>Companionable streams or climb the air; 
<BR>Their hearts have not grown old; 
<BR>Passion or conquest, wander where they will, 
<BR>Attend upon them still. <br><BR>
<BR>But now they drift on the still water 
<BR>Mysterious, beautiful; 
<BR>Among what rushes will they build, 
<BR>By what lake's edge or pool 
<BR>Delight men's eyes, when I awake some day 
<BR>To find they have flown away?<br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>When You Are Old</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>When you are old and gray and full of sleep, 
<BR>And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
<BR>And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
<BR>Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; <br><BR>
<BR>How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
<BR>And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
<BR>But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
<BR>And loved the sorrows of your changing face; <br><BR>
<BR>And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
<BR>Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled 
<BR>And paced among the mountains overhead 
<BR>And hid his face among a crowd of stars. <br><BR>
<p><strong>Sailing to Byzantium</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>That is no country for old men, The young
<BR>In one another's arms, birds in the trees
<BR>-Those dying generations-at their song,
<BR>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
<BR>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
<BR>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
<BR>Caught in that sensual music all neglect
<BR>Monuments of unaging intellect.<br><BR>
<BR>An aged man is but a paltry thing,
<BR>A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
<BR>Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
<BR>For every tatter in its mortal dress,
<BR>Nor is there singing school but stuying 
<BR>Monuments of its own magnificence;
<BR>And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
<BR>To the holy city of Byzantium.<br><BR>
<BR>O sages standing in God's holy fire
<BR>As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
<BR>Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
<BR>And be the singing-masters of my soul.
<BR>Consume my heart away; sick with desire
<BR>And fastened to a dying animal
<BR>It knows not what it is; and gather me
<BR>Into the artifice of eternity.<br><BR>
<BR>Once out of nature I shall never take
<BR>My bodily form from any natural thing,
<BR>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make
<BR>Of hammered gold and gold enameling
<BR>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
<BR>Or set upon a golden bough to sing
<BR>To lords and ladies of Byzantium
<BR>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.<br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>Easter, 1916</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>I have met them at close of day 
<BR>Coming with vivid faces 
<BR>From counter or desk among grey 
<BR>Eighteenth-century houses. 
<BR>I have passed with a nod of the head 
<BR>Or polite meaningless words, 
<BR>Or have lingered awhile and said 
<BR>Polite meaningless words, 
<BR>And thought before I had done 
<BR>Of a mocking tale or a gibe 
<BR>To please a companion 
<BR>Around the fire at the club, 
<BR>Being certain that they and I 
<BR>But lived where motley is worn: 
<BR>All changed, changed utterly: 
<BR>A terrible beauty is born.<br><BR>
<BR>That woman's days were spent 
<BR>In ignorant good will, 
<BR>Her nights in argument 
<BR>Until her voice grew shrill. 
<BR>What voice more sweet than hers 
<BR>When young and beautiful, 
<BR>She rode to harriers? 
<BR>This man had kept a school 
<BR>And rode our winged horse. 
<BR>This other his helper and friend 
<BR>Was coming into his force; 
<BR>He might have won fame in the end, 
<BR>So sensitive his nature seemed, 
<BR>So daring and sweet his thought. 
<BR>This other man I had dreamed 
<BR>A drunken, vain-glorious lout. 
<BR>He had done most bitter wrong 
<BR>To some who are near my heart, 
<BR>Yet I number him in the song; 
<BR>He, too, has resigned his part 
<BR>In the casual comedy; 
<BR>He, too, has been changed in his turn, 
<BR>Transformed utterly: 
<BR>A terrible beauty is born.<br><BR>
<BR>Hearts with one purpose alone 
<BR>Through summer and winter seem 
<BR>Enchanted to a stone 
<BR>To trouble the living stream. 
<BR>The horse that comes from the road. 
<BR>The rider, the birds that range 
<BR>From cloud to tumbling cloud, 
<BR>Minute by minute change; 
<BR>A shadow of cloud on the stream 
<BR>Changes minute by minute; 
<BR>A horse-hoof slides on the brim, 
<BR>And a horse plashes within it 
<BR>Where long-legged moor-hens dive, 
<BR>And hens to moor-cocks call. 
<BR>Minute by minute they live: 
<BR>The stone's in the midst of all.<br><BR>
<BR>Too long a sacrifice 
<BR>Can make a stone of the heart. 
<BR>O when may it suffice? 
<BR>That is heaven's part, our part 
<BR>To murmur name upon name, 
<BR>As a mother names her child 
<BR>When sleep at last has come 
<BR>On limbs that had run wild. 
<BR>What is it but nightfall? 
<BR>No, no, not night but death; 
<BR>Was it needless death after all? 
<BR>For England may keep faith 
<BR>For all that is done and said. 
<BR>We know their dream; enough 
<BR>To know they dreamed and are dead. 
<BR>And what if excess of love 
<BR>Bewildered them till they died? 
<BR>I write it out in a verse - 
<BR>MacDonagh and MacBride 
<BR>And Connolly and Pearse 
<BR>Now and in time to be, 
<BR>Wherever green is worn, 
<BR>Are changed, changed utterly: 
<BR>A terrible beauty is born. <br><BR>
<p><strong>The Song of Wandering Aengus</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>I went out to the hazel wood, 
<BR>Because a fire was in my head, 
<BR>And cut and peeled a hazel wand, 
<BR>And hooked a berry to a thread; 
<BR>And when white moths were on the wing, 
<BR>And moth-like stars were flickering out, 
<BR>I dropped the berry in a stream 
<BR>And caught a little silver trout.<br><BR>
<BR>When I had laid it on the floor 
<BR>I went to blow the fire aflame, 
<BR>But something rustled on the floor, 
<BR>And some one called me by my name: 
<BR>It had become a glimmering girl 
<BR>With apple blossom in her hair 
<BR>Who called me by my name and ran 
<BR>And faded through the brightening air.<br><BR>
<BR>Though I am old with wandering 
<BR>Through hollow lands and hilly lands, 
<BR>I will find out where she has gone, 
<BR>And kiss her lips and take her hands; 
<BR>And wak among long dappled grass, 
<BR>And pluck till time and times are done 
<BR>The silver apples of the moon, 
<BR>The golden apples of the sun. <br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>The Lake Isle of Innisfree</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, 
<BR>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made: 
<BR>Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee, 
<BR>And live alone in the bee-loud glade. <br><BR>
<BR>And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow 
<BR>Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; 
<BR>There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, 
<BR>And evenings full of the linnet's wings. <br><BR>
<BR>I will arise and go now, for always night and day 
<BR>I hear the lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; 
<BR>While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray, 
<BR>I hear it in the deep heart's core. <br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>The Scholars</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>Bald heads forgetful of their sins,
<BR>Old, learned, respectable bald heads
<BR>Edit and annotate the lines
<BR>That young men, tossing on their beds,
<BR>Rhymed out in love's despair
<BR>To flatter beauty's ignorant ear.<br><BR>
<BR>All shuffle there; all cough in ink;
<BR>All wear the carpet with their shoes;
<BR>All think what other people think;
<BR>All know the man their neighbour knows.
<BR>Lord, what would they say
<BR>Did their Catullus walk that way?<br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>The Hero, the Girl, and the Fool</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>The Girl. I rage at my own image in the glass,
<BR>That's so unlike myself that when you praise it
<BR>It is as though you praised another, or even
<BR>Mocked me with praise of my mere opposite;
<BR>And when I wake towards morn I dread myself
<BR>For the heart cries that what deception wins
<BR>Cruelty must keep; therefore be warned and go
<BR>If you have seen that image and not the woman.<br><BR>
<BR>The Hero. I have raged at my own strength because you have loved it.<br><BR>
<BR>The Girl. If you are no more strength than I am beauty
<BR>I had better find a convent and turn nun;
<BR>A nun at least has all men's reverence
<BR>And needs no cruelty.<br><BR>
<BR>The Hero.                  I have heard one say
<BR>That men have reverence for their holiness
<BR>And not themselves.<br><BR>
<BR>The Girl.                    Say on and say
<BR>That only God has loved us for ourselves,
<BR>But what care I that long for a man's love?<br><BR>
<BR>The Fool by the Roadside. When my days that have
<BR>From cradle run to grave
<BR>From grave to cradle run instead;
<BR>When thoughts that a fool
<BR>Has wound upon a spool
<BR>Are but loose thread, are but loose thread;<br><BR>
<BR>When cradle and spool are past
<BR>And I mere shade at last
<BR>Coagulate of stuff
<BR>Transparent like the wind,
<BR>I think that I may find
<BR>A faithful love, a faithful love.<br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>Leda and the Swan</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
<BR>Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
<BR>By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
<BR>He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.<br><BR>
<BR>How can those terrified vague fingers push
<BR>The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
<BR>And how can body, laid in that white rush,
<BR>But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?<br><BR>
<BR>A shudder in the loins engenders there
<BR>The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
<BR>And Agamemnon dead.
<BR>                               Being so caught up,
<BR>So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
<BR>Did she put on his knowledge with his power
<BR>Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?<br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>An Irish Airman Forsees His Death</strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>I know that I shall meet my fate 
<BR>Somewhere among the clouds above; 
<BR>Those that I fight I do not hate, 
<BR>Those that I guard I do not love; 
<BR>My country is Kiltartan Cross, 
<BR>My countrymen Kiltartan's poor, 
<BR>No likely end could bring them loss 
<BR>Or leave them happier than before. 
<BR>Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, 
<BR>Nor public men, nor cheering crowds, 
<BR>A lonely impulse of delight 
<BR>Drove to this tummult in the clouds; 
<BR>I balanced all, brought all to mind, 
<BR>The years to come seemed waste of breath, 
<BR>A waste of breath the years behind 
<BR>In balance with this life, this death. <br><BR>
<p> 
<p><strong>Love Song </strong><BR><em>W B Yeats</em>
<BR>
<BR>From the Gaelic<br><BR>
<BR>My love, we will go, we will go, I and you, 
<BR>And away in the woods we will scatter the dew; 
<BR>And the salmon behold, and the ousel too, 
<BR>My love, we will hear, I and you, we will hear, 
<BR>The calling afar of the doe and the deer. 
<BR>And the bird in the branches will cry for us clear, 
<BR>And the cuckoo unseen in his festival mood; 
<BR>And death, oh my fair one, will never come near 
<BR>In the bosom afar of the fragrant wood. <br><BR>

<BR> And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape
<BR> As recollection or the drug decide,
<BR> Would think her Son, did she but see that shape
<BR> With sixty or more winters on its head,
<BR> A compensation for the pang of his birth,
<BR> Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?<br><BR>

<BR> Plato thought nature but a spume that plays
<BR> Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;
<BR> Solider Aristotle played the taws
<BR> Upon the bottom of a king of kings;
<BR> World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras
<BR> Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings
<BR> What a star sang and careless Muses heard:
<BR> Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.<br><BR>

<BR> 
<BR> Both nuns and mothers worship images,
<BR> But those the candles light are not as those
<BR> That animate a mother's reveries,
<BR> But keep a marble or a bronze repose.
<BR> And yet they too break hearts - O presences
<BR> That passion, piety or affection knows,
<BR> And that all heavenly glory symbolise - 
<BR> O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;<br><BR> 
<BR>                     <div align="center">VIII</div>
<BR> 
<BR> Labour is blossoming or dancing where
<BR> The body is not bruised to pleasure soul.
<BR> Nor beauty born out of its own despair,
<BR> Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.
<BR> O chestnut-tree, great-rooted blossomer,
<BR> Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
<BR> O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
<BR> How can we know the dancer from the dance?<br><BR>

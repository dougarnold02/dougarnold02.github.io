<p><strong>Autumn in California</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>    Autumn in California is a mild 
<BR>    And anonymous season, hills and valleys 
<BR>    Are colorless then, only the sooty green 
<BR>    Eucalyptus, the conifers and oaks sink deep 
<BR>    Into the haze; the fields are plowed, bare, waiting; 
<BR>    The steep pastures are tracked deep by the cattle; 
<BR>    There are no flowers, the herbage is brittle. 
<BR>    All night along the coast and the mountain crests 
<BR>    Birds go by, murmurous, high in the warm air. 
<BR>    Only in the mountain meadows the aspens 
<BR>    Glitter like goldfish moving up swift water; 
<BR>    Only in the desert villages the leaves 
<BR>    Of the cottonwoods descend in smoky air. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more I wander in the warm evening 
<BR>    Calling the heart to order and the stiff brain 
<BR>    To passion. I should be thinking of dreaming, loving, dying, 
<BR>    Beauty wasting through time like draining blood, 
<BR>    And me alone in all the world with pictures 
<BR>    Of pretty women and the constellations. 
<BR>    But I hear the clocks in Barcelona strike at dawn 
<BR>    And the whistles blowing for noon in Nanking. 
<BR>    I hear the drone, the snapping high in the air 
<BR>    Of planes fighting, the deep reverberant 
<BR>    Grunts of bombardment, the hasty clamor 
<BR>    Of anti-aircraft. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nanking at the first bomb, 
<BR>    A moon-faced, willowy young girl runs into the street, 
<BR>    Leaves her rice bowl spilled and her children crying, 
<BR>    And stands stiff, cursing quietly, her face raised to the sky. 
<BR>    Suddenly she bursts like a bag of water, 
<BR>    And then as the blossom of smoke and dust diffuses, 
<BR>    The walls topple slowly over her. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the voices 
<BR>    Young, fatigued and excited, of two comrades 
<BR>    In a closed room in Madrid. They have been up 
<BR>    All night, talking of trout in the Pyrenees, 
<BR>    Spinoza, old nights full of riot and sherry, 
<BR>    Women they might have had or almost had, 
<BR>    Picasso, Velasquez, relativity. 
<BR>    The candlelight reddens, blue bars appear 
<BR>    In the cracks of the shutters, the bombardment 
<BR>    Begins again as though it had never stopped, 
<BR>    The morning wind is cold and dusty, 
<BR>    Their furloughs are over. They are shock troopers, 
<BR>    They may not meet again. The dead light holds 
<BR>    In impersonal focus the patched uniforms, 
<BR>    The dog-eared copy of Lenin's Imperialism, 
<BR>    The heavy cartridge belt, holster and black revolver butt. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon rises late over Mt. Diablo, 
<BR>    Huge, gibbous, warm; the wind goes out, 
<BR>    Brown fog spreads over the bay from the marshes, 
<BR>    And overhead the cry of birds is suddenly 
<BR>    Loud, wiry, and tremulous.

<p><strong>August 22, 1939</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>    <i>". . . when you want to distract your mother from the
<BR>      discouraging soulness, I will tell you what I used to do. To
<BR>      take her for a long walk in the quiet country, gathering
<BR>      wildflowers here and there, resting under the shade of trees,
<BR>      between the harmony of the vivid stream and the tranquillity of
<BR>      the mother-nature, and I am sure she will enjoy this very much,
<BR>      as you surely will be happy for it. But remember always, Dante,
<BR>      in the play of happiness, don't use all for yourself only, but
<BR>      down yourself just one step, at your side and help the weak
<BR>      ones that cry for help, help the prosecuted and the victim;
<BR>      because they are your friends; they are the comrades that fight
<BR>      and fall as your father and Bartolo fought and fell yesterday,
<BR>      for the conquest of the joy of freedom for all and the poor
<BR>      workers. In this struggle of life you will find more love and
<BR>      you will be loved." <br><BR>
<BR>      -- Nicola Sacco to his son Dante, Aug. 18, 1927.</i><br><BR>
<BR>     <i>Angst und Gestalt und Gebet --Rilke</i><br><BR>
<BR>    What is it all for, this poetry, 
<BR>    This bundle of accomplishment 
<BR>    Put together with so much pain? 
<BR>    Twenty years at hard labor, 
<BR>    Lessons learned from Li Po and Dante, 
<BR>    Indian chants and gestalt psychology; 
<BR>    What words can it spell, 
<BR>    This alphabet of one sensibility? 
<BR>    The pure pattern of the stars in orderly progression, 
<BR>    The thin air of fourteen-thousand-foot summits, 
<BR>    Their Pisgah views into what secrets of the personality, 
<BR>    The fire of poppies in eroded fields, 
<BR>    The sleep of lynxes in the noonday forest, 
<BR>    The curious anastomosis of the webs of thought, 
<BR>    Life streaming ungovernably away, 
<BR>    And the deep hope of man. 
<BR>    The centuries have changed little in this art, 
<BR>    The subjects are still the same. 
<BR>    "For Christ's sake take off your clothes and get into bed, 
<BR>    We are not going to live forever." 
<BR>    "Petals fall from the rose," 
<BR>    We fall from life, 
<BR>    Values fall from history like men from shellfire, 
<BR>    Only a minimum survives, 
<BR>    Only an unknown achievement. 
<BR>    They can put it all on the headstones, 
<BR>    In all the battlefields, 
<BR>    "Poor guy, he never knew what it was all about." 
<BR>    Spectacled men will come with shovels in a thousand years, 
<BR>    Give lectures in universities on cultural advances, cultural lags. 
<BR>    A little more garlic in the soup, 
<BR>    A half-hour more in bed in the morning, 
<BR>    Some of them got it, some of them didn't; 
<BR>    The things they dropped in their hurry 
<BR>    Are behind the glass cases of dusky museums. 
<BR>    This year we made four major ascents, 
<BR>    Camped for two weeks at timberline, 
<BR>    Watched Mars swim close to the earth, 
<BR>    Watched the black aurora of war 
<BR>    Spread over the sky of a decayed civilization. 
<BR>    These are the last terrible years of authority. 
<BR>    The disease has reached its crisis, 
<BR>    Ten thousand years of power, 
<BR>    The struggle of two laws, 
<BR>    The rule of iron and spilled blood, 
<BR>    The abiding solidarity of living blood and brain. 
<BR>    They are trapped, beleaguered, murderous, 
<BR>    If they line their cellars with cork 
<BR>    It is not to still the pistol shots, 
<BR>    It is to insulate the last words of the condemned. 
<BR>    "Liberty is the mother 
<BR>    Not the daughter of order." 
<BR>    "Not the government of men 
<BR>    But the administration of things." 
<BR>    "From each according to his ability, 
<BR>    Unto each according to his needs." 
<BR>    We could still hear them, 
<BR>    Cutting steps in the blue ice of hanging glaciers, 
<BR>    Teetering along shattered ar&ecirc;tes. 
<BR>    The cold and cruel apathy of mountains 
<BR>    Has been subdued with a few strands of rope 
<BR>    And some flimsy iceaxes, 
<BR>    There are only a few peaks left. 
<BR>    Twenty-five years have gone since my first sweetheart. 
<BR>    Back from the mountains there is a letter waiting for me. 
<BR>    "I read your poem in the New Republic. 
<BR>    Do you remember the undertaker's on the corner, 
<BR>    How we peeped in the basement window at a sheeted figure 
<BR>    And ran away screaming? Do you remember? 
<BR>    There is a filling station on the corner, 
<BR>    A parking lot where your house used to be, 
<BR>    Only ours and two other houses are left. 
<BR>    We stick it out in the noise and carbon monoxide." 
<BR>    It was a poem of homesickness and exile, 
<BR>    Twenty-five years wandering around 
<BR>    In a world of noise and poison. 
<BR>    She stuck it out, I never went back, 
<BR>    But there are domestic as well as imported 
<BR>    Explosions and poison gases. 
<BR>    Dante was homesick, the Chinese made an art of it, 
<BR>    So was Ovid and many others, 
<BR>    Pound and Eliot amongst them, 
<BR>    Kropotkin dying of hunger, 
<BR>    Berkman by his own hand, 
<BR>    Fanny Baron biting her executioners, 
<BR>    Mahkno in the odor of calumny, 
<BR>    Trotsky, too, I suppose, passionately, after his fashion. 
<BR>    Do you remember? 
<BR>    What is it all for, this poetry, 
<BR>    This bundle of accomplishment 
<BR>    Put together with so much pain? 
<BR>    Do you remember the corpse in the basement? 
<BR>    What are we doing at the turn of our years, 
<BR>    Writers and readers of the liberal weeklies? 
<BR>

<p><strong>From the Paris Commune to
    the Kronstadt Rebellion</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em> 
<BR>
<BR>    Remember now there were others before this; 
<BR>    Now when the unwanted hours rise up, 
<BR>    And the sun rises red in unknown quarters, 
<BR>    And the constellations change places, 
<BR>    And cloudless thunder erases the furrows, 
<BR>    And moonlight stains and the stars grow hot. 
<BR>    Though the air is fetid, conscripted fathers, 
<BR>    With the black bloat of your dead faces; 
<BR>    Though men wander idling out of factories 
<BR>    Where turbine and hand are both freezing; 
<BR>    And the air clears at last above the chimneys; 
<BR>    Though mattresses curtain the windows; 
<BR>    And every hour hears the snarl of explosion; 
<BR>    Yet one shall rise up alone saying: 
<BR>    "I am one out of many, I have heard 
<BR>    Voices high in the air crying out commands; 
<BR>    Seen men's bodies burst into torches; 
<BR>    Seen faun and maiden die in the night air raids; 
<BR>    Heard the watchwords exchanged in the alleys; 
<BR>    Felt hate speed the blood stream and fear curl the nerves. 
<BR>    I know too the last heavy maggot; 
<BR>    And know the trapped vertigo of impotence. 
<BR>    I have traveled prone and unwilling 
<BR>    In the dense processions through the shaken streets. 
<BR>    Shall we hang thus by taut navel strings 
<BR>    To this corrupt placenta till we're flyblown; 
<BR>    Till our skulls are cracked by crow and kite 
<BR>    And our members become the business of ants, 
<BR>    Our teeth the collection of magpies?" 
<BR>    They shall rise up heroes, there will be many, 
<BR>    None will prevail against them at last. 
<BR>    They go saying each: "I am one of many"; 
<BR>    Their hands empty save for history. 
<BR>    They die at bridges, bridge gates, and drawbridges. 
<BR>    Remember now there were others before; 
<BR>    The sepulchres are full at ford and bridgehead. 
<BR>    There will be children with flowers there, 
<BR>    And lambs and golden-eyed lions there, 
<BR>    And people remembering in the future.

<p><p><strong>Requiem for the Spanish Dead</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>    The great geometrical winter constellations 
<BR>    Lift up over the Sierra Nevada, 
<BR>    I walk under the stars, my feet on the known round earth. 
<BR>    My eyes following the lights of an airplane, 
<BR>    Red and green, growling deep into the Hyades. 
<BR>    The note of the engine rises, shrill, faint, 
<BR>    Finally inaudible, and the lights go out 
<BR>    In the southeast haze beneath the feet of Orion. <br><BR>
<BR>    As the sound departs I am chilled and grow sick 
<BR>    With the thought that has come over me. I see Spain 
<BR>    Under the black windy sky, the snow stirring faintly, 
<BR>    Glittering and moving over the pallid upland, 
<BR>    And men waiting, clutched with cold and huddled together, 
<BR>    As an unknown plane goes over them. It flies southeast 
<BR>    Into the haze above the lines of the enemy, 
<BR>    Sparks appear near the horizon under it. 
<BR>    After they have gone out the earth quivers 
<BR>    And the sound comes faintly. The men relax for a moment 
<BR>    And grow tense again as their own thoughts return to them. <br><BR>
<BR>    I see the unwritten books, the unrecorded experiments, 
<BR>    The unpainted pictures, the interrupted lives, 
<BR>    Lowered into the graves with the red flags over them. 
<BR>    I see the quick gray brains broken and clotted with blood, 
<BR>    Lowered each in its own darkness, useless in the earth. 
<BR>    Alone on a hilltop in San Francisco suddenly 
<BR>    I am caught in a nightmare, the dead flesh 
<BR>    Mounting over half the world presses against me. <br><BR>
<BR>    Then quietly at first and then rich and full-bodied, 
<BR>    I hear the voice of a young woman singing. 
<BR>    The emigrants on the corner are holding 
<BR>    A wake for their oldest child, a driverless truck 
<BR>    Broke away on the steep hill and killed him, 
<BR>    Voice after voice adds itself to the singing. 
<BR>    Orion moves westward across the meridian, 
<BR>    Rigel, Bellatrix, Betelgeuse, marching in order, 
<BR>    The great nebula glimmering in his loins. <br><BR>

<BR>
<p><p><strong>On What Planet </strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>    Uniformly over the whole countryside 
<BR>    The warm air flows imperceptibly seaward; 
<BR>    The autumn haze drifts in deep bands 
<BR>    Over the pale water; 
<BR>    White egrets stand in the blue marshes; 
<BR>    Tamalpais, Diablo, St. Helena 
<BR>    Float in the air. 
<BR>    Climbing on the cliffs of Hunter's Hill 
<BR>    We look out over fifty miles of sinuous 
<BR>    Interpenetration of mountains and sea. <br><BR>
<BR>    Leading up a twisted chimney, 
<BR>    Just as my eyes rise to the level 
<BR>    Of a small cave, two white owls 
<BR>    Fly out, silent, close to my face. 
<BR>    They hover, confused in the sunlight, 
<BR>    And disappear into the recesses of the cliff. <br><BR>
<BR>    All day I have been watching a new climber, 
<BR>    A young girl with ash blond hair 
<BR>    And gentle confident eyes. 
<BR>    She climbs slowly, precisely, 
<BR>    With unwasted grace. 
<BR>    While I am coiling the ropes, 
<BR>    Watching the spectacular sunset, 
<BR>    She turns to me and says, quietly, 
<BR>    "It must be very beautiful, the sunset, 
<BR>    On Saturn, with the rings and all the moons."

<p><p><strong>Climbing Milestone Mountain 
    August 22, 1937</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>    For a month now, wandering over the Sierras, 
<BR>    A poem had been gathering in my mind, 
<BR>    Details of significance and rhythm, 
<BR>    The way poems do, but still lacking a focus. 
<BR>    Last night I remembered the date and it all 
<BR>    Began to grow together and take on purpose. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat up late while Deneb moved over the zenith 
<BR>    And I told Marie all about Boston, how it looked 
<BR>    That last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping 
<BR>    Impotent in the streets that last midnight. 
<BR>    I told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands, 
<BR>    How America was forever a different place 
<BR>    Afterwards for many. 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning 
<BR>    We swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue 
<BR>    Damsel flies on all the reeds like millions 
<BR>    Of narrow metallic flowers, and I thought 
<BR>    Of you behind the grille in Dedham, Vanzetti, 
<BR>    Saying, "Who would ever have thought we would make this history?" 
<BR>    Crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow 
<BR>    Illuminated with asters and cyclamen, 
<BR>    The pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting 
<BR>    With the shifting wind over it and the blue 
<BR>    And sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind, 
<BR>    I saw you in the sour prison light, saying, 
<BR>    "Goodbye comrade." 
<BR>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basin under the crest 
<BR>    Where the pines end and the Sierra primrose begins, 
<BR>    A party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle. 
<BR>    The bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it. 
<BR>    Looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake, 
<BR>    The pattern of human beings seemed simpler 
<BR>    Than the diagonals of water and stone. 
<BR>    Climbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock, 
<BR>    I remembered what you said about Sacco, 
<BR>    How it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record. 
<BR>    Traversing below the ragged ar&ecirc;te, 
<BR>    One cheek pressed against the rock 
<BR>    The wind slapping the other, 
<BR>    I saw you both marching in an army 
<BR>    You with the red and black flag, Sacco with the rattlesnake banner. 
<BR>    I kicked steps up the last snow bank and came 
<BR>    To the indescribably blue and fragrant 
<BR>    Polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile 
<BR>    Crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit. 
<BR>    These are the things that will last a long time, Vanzetti, 
<BR>    I am glad that once on your day I have stood among them. 
<BR>    Some day mountains will be named after you and Sacco. 
<BR>    They will be here and your name with them, 
<BR>    "When these days are but a dim remembering of the time 
<BR>    When man was wolf to man." 
<BR>    I think men will be remembering you a long time 
<BR>    Standing on the mountains 
<BR>    Many men, a long time, comrade.

<p><strong>Proust's Madeleine</strong><BR><em>Kenneth Rexroth</em>
<BR>
<BR>Somebody has given my
<BR>Baby daughter a box of
<BR>Old poker chips to play with.
<BR>Today she hands me one while
<BR>I am sitting with my tired
<BR>Brain at my desk. It is red.
<BR>On it is a picture of
<BR>An elk's head and the letters
<BR>B.P.O.E.?a chip from
<BR>A small town Elks' Club. I flip
<BR>It idly in the air and
<BR>Catch it and do a coin trick
<BR>To amuse my little girl.
<BR>Suddenly everything slips aside.
<BR>I see my father
<BR>Doing the very same thing,
<BR>Whistling "Beautiful Dreamer,"
<BR>His breath smelling richly
<BR>Of whiskey and cigars. I can
<BR>Hear him coming home drunk
<BR>From the Elks' Club in Elkhart
<BR>Indiana, bumping the
<BR>Chairs in the dark. I can see
<BR>Him dying of cirrhosis
<BR>Of the liver and stomach
<BR>Ulcers and pneumonia,
<BR>Or, as he said on his deathbed, of
<BR>Crooked cards and straight whiskey,
<BR>Slow horses and fast women.

<h1>D H Lawrence</h1>
<strong>Snake</strong><BR><em>D H Lawrence</em>
<BR> 
<BR> A snake came to my water-trough
<BR> On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
<BR> To drink there.<br><BR> 
<BR> In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
<BR> I came down the steps with my pitcher
<BR> And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before me.<br><BR> 
<BR> He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
<BR> And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the 
<BR>   edge of the stone trough
<BR> And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
<BR> And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
<BR> He sipped with his straight mouth,
<BR> Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
<BR> Silently.<br><BR> 
<BR> Someone was before me at my water-trough,
<BR> And I, like a second-comer, waiting.<br><BR> 
<BR> He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
<BR> And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
<BR> And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a  moment,
<BR> And stooped and drank a little more,
<BR> Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth
<BR> On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.<br><BR> 
<BR> The voice of my education said to me
<BR> He must be killed,
<BR> For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.
<BR> And voices in me said, If you were a man
<BR> You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.<br><BR> 
<BR> But must I confess how I liked him,
<BR> How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough
<BR> And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
<BR> Into the burning bowels of this earth?<br><BR> 
<BR> Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
<BR> Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
<BR> Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
<BR> I felt so honoured.<br><BR> 
<BR> And yet those voices:
<BR> If you were not afraid, you would kill him!<br><BR> 
<BR> And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
<BR> But even so, honoured still more
<BR> That he should seek my hospitality
<BR> From out the dark door of the secret earth.<br><BR> 
<BR> He drank enough
<BR> And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
<BR> And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
<BR> Seeming to lick his lips,
<BR> And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
<BR> And slowly turned his head,
<BR> And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
<BR> Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
<BR> And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.<br><BR> 
<BR> And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
<BR> And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,
<BR> A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into 
<BR>   that horrid black hole,
<BR> Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,
<BR> Overcame me now his back was turned.<br><BR> 
<BR> I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
<BR> I picked up a clumsy log
<BR> And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.<br><BR> 
<BR> I think it did not hit him,
<BR> But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in 
<BR>   undignified haste,
<BR> Writhed like lightning, and was gone
<BR> Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
<BR> At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.<br><BR> 
<BR> And immediately I regretted it.
<BR> I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
<BR> I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.<br><BR> 
<BR> And I thought of the albatross,
<BR> And I wished he would come back, my snake.<br><BR> 
<BR> For he seemed to me again like a king,
<BR> Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
<BR> Now due to be crowned again.<br><BR> 
<BR> And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
<BR> Of life.
<BR> And I have something to expiate:
<BR> A pettiness.<br><BR>

<strong>Night Mail</strong><BR><em>W H Auden</em>
<BR>
<BR> This is the Night Mail crossing the border,
<BR> Bringing the cheque and the postal order,
<BR> Letters for the rich, letters for the poor,
<BR> The shop at the corner and the girl next door.
<BR> Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb:
<BR> The gradient's against her, but she's on time.
<BR> Past cotton-grass and moorland boulder
<BR> Shovelling white steam over her shoulder,
<BR> Snorting noisily as she passes
<BR> Silent miles of wind-bent grasses.<br><BR> 
<BR> Birds turn their heads as she approaches,
<BR> Stare from the bushes at her blank-faced coaches.
<BR> Sheep-dogs cannot turn her course;
<BR> They slumber on with paws across.
<BR> In the farm she passes no one wakes,
<BR> But a jug in the bedroom gently shakes.<br><BR> 
<BR> Dawn freshens, the climb is done.
<BR> Down towards Glasgow she descends
<BR> Towards the steam tugs yelping down the glade of cranes,  Towards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces  Set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.  All Scotland waits for her:  In the dark glens, beside the pale-green sea lochs  Men long for news.<br><BR> 
<BR> Letters of thanks, letters from banks,
<BR> Letters of joy from the girl and the boy,
<BR> Receipted bills and invitations
<BR> To inspect new stock or visit relations,
<BR> And applications for situations
<BR> And timid lovers' declarations
<BR> And gossip, gossip from all the nations,
<BR> News circumstantial, news financial,
<BR> Letters with holiday snaps to enlarge in,
<BR> Letters with faces scrawled in the margin,
<BR> Letters from uncles, cousins, and aunts,
<BR> Letters to Scotland from the South of France,
<BR> Letters of condolence to Highlands and Lowlands
<BR> Notes from overseas to Hebrides
<BR> Written on paper of every hue,
<BR> The pink, the violet, the white and the blue,
<BR> The chatty, the catty, the boring, adoring,
<BR> The cold and official and the heart's outpouring,
<BR> Clever, stupid, short and long,
<BR> The typed and the printed and the spelt all wrong.<br><BR> 
<BR> Thousands are still asleep
<BR> Dreaming of terrifying monsters,
<BR> Or of friendly tea beside the band at Cranston's or Crawford's:  Asleep in working Glasgow, asleep in well-set Edinburgh,  Asleep in granite Aberdeen,  They continue their dreams,  And shall wake soon and long for letters,  And none will hear the postman's knock  Without a quickening of the heart,  For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?

<p><strong>Epitaph on a tyrant</strong><BR><em>W. H. Auden</em>
<BR>
<BR> Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after
<BR> And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
<BR> He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
<BR> And was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
<BR> When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
<BR> And when he cried the little children died in the streets.
<BR>
<BR>
<p><strong>Musee des Beaux Arts</strong><BR><em>W. H. Auden</em>
<BR>
<BR>           About suffering they were never wrong,
<BR>           The Old Masters: how well they understood
<BR>           Its human position; how it takes place
<BR>           While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;
<BR>           How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
<BR>           For the miraculous birth, there always must be
<BR>           Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
<BR>           On a pond at the edge of the wood:
<BR>           They never forgot
<BR>           That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
<BR>           Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
<BR>           Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
<BR>           Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
<BR>           In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
<BR>           Quite leisurely from the disaster; the plowman may
<BR>           Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
<BR>           But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
<BR>           As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
<BR>           Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
<BR>           Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
<BR>           Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

<p><strong>September 1, 1939</strong><BR><em>W H Auden</em>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>                             I sit in one of the dives
<BR>                             On Fifty-second street
<BR>                             Uncertain and afraid
<BR>                             As the clever hopes expire
<BR>                             Of a low dishonest decade:
<BR>                             Waves of anger and fear
<BR>                             Circulate over the bright
<BR>                             and darkened lands of the earth,
<BR>                             Obsessing our private lives;
<BR>                             The unmentionable odour of death
<BR>                             Offends the September night.<br><BR>
<BR>                             Accurate scholarship can
<BR>                             unearth the whole offence
<BR>                             From Luther until now
<BR>                             That has driven a culture mad,
<BR>                             Find what occurred at Linz,
<BR>                             What huge imago made
<BR>                             A psychopathic god:
<BR>                             I and the public know
<BR>                             What all schoolchildren learn,
<BR>                             Those to whom evil is done
<BR>                             Do evil in return.<br><BR>
<BR>                             Exiled Thucydides knew
<BR>                             All that a speech can say
<BR>                             About Democracy,
<BR>                             And what dictators do,
<BR>                             The elderly rubbish they talk
<BR>                             To an apathetic grave;
<BR>                             Analysed all in his book,
<BR>                             The enlightenment driven away,
<BR>                             The habit-forming pain,
<BR>                             Mismanagement and grief:
<BR>                             We must suffer them all again.<br><BR>
<BR>                             Into this neutral air
<BR>                             Where blind skyscrapers use
<BR>                             Their full height to proclaim
<BR>                             The strength of Collective Man,
<BR>                             Each language pours its vain
<BR>                             Competitive excuse:
<BR>                             But who can live for long
<BR>                             In an euphoric dream;
<BR>                             Out of the mirror they stare,
<BR>                             Imperialism's face
<BR>                             And the international wrong.<br><BR>
<BR>                             Faces along the bar
<BR>                             Cling to their average day:
<BR>                             The lights must never go out,
<BR>                             The music must always play,
<BR>                             All the conventions conspire
<BR>                             To make this fort assume
<BR>                             The furniture of home;
<BR>                             Lest we should see where we are,
<BR>                             Lost in a haunted wood,
<BR>                             Children afraid of the night
<BR>                             who have never been happy or good.<br><BR>
<BR>                             The windiest militant trash
<BR>                             Important Persons shout
<BR>                             Is not so crude as our wish:
<BR>                             What mad Nijinsky wrote
<BR>                             About Diaghilev
<BR>                             Is true of the normal heart;
<BR>                             For the error bred in the bone
<BR>                             Of each woman and each man
<BR>                             Craves what it cannot have,
<BR>                             Not universal love
<BR>                             But to be loved alone.<br><BR>
<BR>                             From the conservative dark
<BR>                             Into the ethical life
<BR>                             The dense commuters come,
<BR>                             Repeating their morning vow,
<BR>                             "I will be true to the wife.
<BR>                             I'll concentrate more on my work,"
<BR>                             And helpless governors wake
<BR>                             To resume their compulsory game:
<BR>                             Who can release them now,
<BR>                             Who can reach the deaf,
<BR>                             Who can speak for the dumb?<br><BR>
<BR>                             All I have is a voice
<BR>                             To undo the folded lie,
<BR>                             The romantic lie in the brain
<BR>                             Of the sensual man-in-the-street
<BR>                             And the lie of Authority
<BR>                             Whose buildings grope the sky:
<BR>                             There is no such thing as the State
<BR>                             And no one exists alone;
<BR>                             Hunger allows no choice
<BR>                             To the citizen or the police;
<BR>                             We must love one another or die.<br><BR>
<BR>                             Defenceless under the night
<BR>                             Our world in stupor lies;
<BR>                             Yet, dotted everywhere,
<BR>                             Ironic points of light
<BR>                             Flash out wherever the Just
<BR>                             Exchange their messages;
<BR>                             May I, composed like them
<BR>                             Of Eros and of dust,
<BR>                             Beleaguered by the same
<BR>                             Negation and despair,
<BR>                             Show an affirming flame.

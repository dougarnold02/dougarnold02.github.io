{On Wenlock Edge the Wood's in Trouble (a Shropshire Lad: XXXI)}
{A. E. Houseman}

     On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble; 
         His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;  
     The gale, it plies the saplings double,  
         And thick on Severn snow the leaves.  \\

     'Tt would blow like this through holt and hanger 
         When Uricon the city stood:  
     'Tis the old wind in the old anger,  
         But then it threshed another wood.  \\

     Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman 
       At yonder heaving hill would stare:  
   The blood that warms an English yeoman,  
       The thoughts that hurt him, they were there. \\

   There, like the wind through woods in riot,  
       Through him the gale of life blew high;  
   The tree of man was never quiet:  
       Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.  \\

   The gale, it plies the saplings double,  
       It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone:  
   To-day the Roman and his trouble 
       Are ashes under Uricon.

\begin{poem}
  {Here Dead We Lie}
  {A. E. Housman}

 Here dead we lie 
 Because we did not choose 
 To live and shame the land 
 From which we sprung. \\

 Life, to be sure,  
 Is nothing much to lose, 
 But young men think it is, 
 And we were young.

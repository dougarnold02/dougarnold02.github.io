{Night Mail}
{W H Auden}

 This is the Night Mail crossing the border,
 Bringing the cheque and the postal order,
 Letters for the rich, letters for the poor,
 The shop at the corner and the girl next door.
 Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb:
 The gradient's against her, but she's on time.
 Past cotton-grass and moorland boulder
 Shovelling white steam over her shoulder,
 Snorting noisily as she passes
 Silent miles of wind-bent grasses.\\
 
 Birds turn their heads as she approaches,
 Stare from the bushes at her blank-faced coaches.
 Sheep-dogs cannot turn her course;
 They slumber on with paws across.
 In the farm she passes no one wakes,
 But a jug in the bedroom gently shakes.\\
 
 Dawn freshens, the climb is done.
 Down towards Glasgow she descends
 Towards the steam tugs yelping down the glade of cranes,  Towards the fields of apparatus, the furnaces  Set on the dark plain like gigantic chessmen.  All Scotland waits for her:  In the dark glens, beside the pale-green sea lochs  Men long for news.\\
 
 Letters of thanks, letters from banks,
 Letters of joy from the girl and the boy,
 Receipted bills and invitations
 To inspect new stock or visit relations,
 And applications for situations
 And timid lovers' declarations
 And gossip, gossip from all the nations,
 News circumstantial, news financial,
 Letters with holiday snaps to enlarge in,
 Letters with faces scrawled in the margin,
 Letters from uncles, cousins, and aunts,
 Letters to Scotland from the South of France,
 Letters of condolence to Highlands and Lowlands
 Notes from overseas to Hebrides
 Written on paper of every hue,
 The pink, the violet, the white and the blue,
 The chatty, the catty, the boring, adoring,
 The cold and official and the heart's outpouring,
 Clever, stupid, short and long,
 The typed and the printed and the spelt all wrong.\\
 
 Thousands are still asleep
 Dreaming of terrifying monsters,
 Or of friendly tea beside the band at Cranston's or Crawford's:  Asleep in working Glasgow, asleep in well-set Edinburgh,  Asleep in granite Aberdeen,  They continue their dreams,  And shall wake soon and long for letters,  And none will hear the postman's knock  Without a quickening of the heart,  For who can bear to feel himself forgotten?

{Epitaph on a tyrant}
{W. H. Auden}

 Perfection, of a kind, was what he was after
 And the poetry he invented was easy to understand;
 He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
 And was greatly interested in armies and fleets;
 When he laughed, respectable senators burst with laughter,
 And when he cried the little children died in the streets.

\end{poem}

\begin{poem}
{Musee des Beaux Arts}
{W. H. Auden}

           About suffering they were never wrong,
           The Old Masters: how well they understood
           Its human position; how it takes place
           While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;
           How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
           For the miraculous birth, there always must be
           Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
           On a pond at the edge of the wood:
           They never forgot
           That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
           Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
           Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
           Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
           In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
           Quite leisurely from the disaster; the plowman may
           Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
           But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
           As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
           Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
           Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
           Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

\begin{poem}
{September 1, 1939}
{W H Auden}


                             I sit in one of the dives
                             On Fifty-second street
                             Uncertain and afraid
                             As the clever hopes expire
                             Of a low dishonest decade:
                             Waves of anger and fear
                             Circulate over the bright
                             and darkened lands of the earth,
                             Obsessing our private lives;
                             The unmentionable odour of death
                             Offends the September night.\\

                             Accurate scholarship can
                             unearth the whole offence
                             From Luther until now
                             That has driven a culture mad,
                             Find what occurred at Linz,
                             What huge imago made
                             A psychopathic god:
                             I and the public know
                             What all schoolchildren learn,
                             Those to whom evil is done
                             Do evil in return.\\

                             Exiled Thucydides knew
                             All that a speech can say
                             About Democracy,
                             And what dictators do,
                             The elderly rubbish they talk
                             To an apathetic grave;
                             Analysed all in his book,
                             The enlightenment driven away,
                             The habit-forming pain,
                             Mismanagement and grief:
                             We must suffer them all again.\\

                             Into this neutral air
                             Where blind skyscrapers use
                             Their full height to proclaim
                             The strength of Collective Man,
                             Each language pours its vain
                             Competitive excuse:
                             But who can live for long
                             In an euphoric dream;
                             Out of the mirror they stare,
                             Imperialism's face
                             And the international wrong.\\

                             Faces along the bar
                             Cling to their average day:
                             The lights must never go out,
                             The music must always play,
                             All the conventions conspire
                             To make this fort assume
                             The furniture of home;
                             Lest we should see where we are,
                             Lost in a haunted wood,
                             Children afraid of the night
                             who have never been happy or good.\\

                             The windiest militant trash
                             Important Persons shout
                             Is not so crude as our wish:
                             What mad Nijinsky wrote
                             About Diaghilev
                             Is true of the normal heart;
                             For the error bred in the bone
                             Of each woman and each man
                             Craves what it cannot have,
                             Not universal love
                             But to be loved alone.\\

                             From the conservative dark
                             Into the ethical life
                             The dense commuters come,
                             Repeating their morning vow,
                             ``I will be true to the wife.
                             I'll concentrate more on my work,''
                             And helpless governors wake
                             To resume their compulsory game:
                             Who can release them now,
                             Who can reach the deaf,
                             Who can speak for the dumb?\\

                             All I have is a voice
                             To undo the folded lie,
                             The romantic lie in the brain
                             Of the sensual man-in-the-street
                             And the lie of Authority
                             Whose buildings grope the sky:
                             There is no such thing as the State
                             And no one exists alone;
                             Hunger allows no choice
                             To the citizen or the police;
                             We must love one another or die.\\

                             Defenceless under the night
                             Our world in stupor lies;
                             Yet, dotted everywhere,
                             Ironic points of light
                             Flash out wherever the Just
                             Exchange their messages;
                             May I, composed like them
                             Of Eros and of dust,
                             Beleaguered by the same
                             Negation and despair,
                             Show an affirming flame.

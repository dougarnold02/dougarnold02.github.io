<strong>A Valediction Forbidden Mourning</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR>
<BR>AS virtuous men pass mildly away, 
<BR>And whisper to their souls to go, 
<BR>Whilst some of their sad friends do say, 
<BR>"Now his breath goes," and some say, "No."<br><BR>
<BR>So let us melt, and make no noise,
<BR>No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move; 
<BR>'Twere profanation of our joys 
<BR>To tell the laity our love.<br><BR>
<BR>Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears; 
<BR>Men reckon what it did, and meant; 
<BR>But trepidation of the spheres, 
<BR>Though greater far, is innocent.<br><BR>
<BR>Dull sublunary lovers' love 
<BR>- Whose soul is sense - cannot admit 
<BR>Of absence, 'cause it doth remove 
<BR>The thing which elemented it.<br><BR>
<BR>But we by a love so much refined, 
<BR>That ourselves know not what it is, 
<BR>Inter-assur&egrave;d of the mind, 
<BR>Care less, eyes, lips and hands to miss.<br><BR>
<BR>Our two souls therefore, which are one, 
<BR>Though I must go, endure not yet 
<BR>A breach, but an expansion, 
<BR>Like gold to aery thinness beat.<br><BR>
<BR>If they be two, they are two so 
<BR>As stiff twin compasses are two; 
<BR>Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show 
<BR>To move, but doth, if th' other do.<br><BR>
<BR>And though it in the centre sit, 
<BR>Yet, when the other far doth roam, 
<BR>It leans, and hearkens after it, 
<BR>And grows erect, as that comes home.<br><BR>
<BR>Such wilt thou be to me, who must, 
<BR>Like th' other foot, obliquely run; 
<BR>Thy firmness makes my circle just, 
<BR>And makes me end where I begun.<br><BR>
<p><strong>The Good-Morrow</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR>
<BR>I wonder by my troth, what thou and I 
<BR>Did, till we lov'd? Were we not wean'd till then, 
<BR>But suck'd on country pleasures, childishly? 
<BR>Or snorted we in the seven sleepers' den? 
<BR>'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be. 
<BR>If ever any beauty I did see, 
<BR>Which I desir'd, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.<br><BR>
<BR>And now good morrow to our waking souls, 
<BR>Which watch not one another out of fear; 
<BR>For love, all love of other sights controls, 
<BR>And makes one little room, an everywhere. 
<BR>Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, 
<BR>Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, 
<BR>Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.<br><BR>
<BR>My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, 
<BR>And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; 
<BR>Where can we find two better hemispheres, 
<BR>Without sharp north, without declining west? 
<BR>Whatever dies, was not mix'd equally; 
<BR>If our two loves be one, or, thou and I 
<BR>Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.<br><BR>
<p><strong>Only Our Love</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR>
<BR>Only our love hath no decay; 
<BR>This, no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday, 
<BR>Running it never runs from us away, 
<BR>But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.
<BR>
<p><strong>Sweetest Love, I do not go</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR> 
<BR>Sweetest love, I do not go 
<BR>For weariness of thee, 
<BR>Nor in hope the world can show 
<BR>A fitter love for me; 
<BR>But since that I 
<BR>Must die at last, 'tis best 
<BR>Thus to use myself in jest, 
<BR>By feigned death to die.<br><BR>
<BR>Yesternight the sun went hence, 
<BR>And yet is here to - day; 
<BR>He hath no desire nor sense, 
<BR>Nor half so short a way. 
<BR>Then fear not me, 
<BR>But believe that I shall make 
<BR>Hastier journeys, since I take 
<BR>More wings and spurs than he.<br><BR>
<BR>O how feeble is man's power, 
<BR>That, if good fortune fall, 
<BR>Cannot add another hour, 
<BR>Nor a lost hour recall. 
<BR>But come bad chance, 
<BR>And we join to it our strength, 
<BR>And we teach it art and length, 
<BR>Itself o'er us t' advance.<br><BR>
<BR>When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st no wind, 
<BR>But sigh'st my soul away; 
<BR>When thou weep'st, unkindly kind, 
<BR>My life's blood doth decay. 
<BR>It cannot be 
<BR>That thou lov'st me as thou say'st, 
<BR>If in thine my life thou waste, 
<BR>That art the best of me.<br><BR>
<BR>Let not thy divining heart 
<BR>Forethink me any ill. 
<BR>Destiny may take thy part 
<BR>And may thy fears fulfil; 
<BR>But think that we 
<BR>Are but turned aside to sleep: 
<BR>They who one another keep 
<BR>Alive, ne'er parted be.<br><BR>
<p><strong>Loves' Infinitenesse</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR> 
<BR>If yet I have not all thy love, 
<BR>Deare, I shall never have it all, 
<BR>I cannot breath one other sigh, to move; 
<BR>Nor can intreat one other teare to fall. 
<BR>And all my treasure, which should purchase thee, 
<BR>Sighs, teares and oathes, and letters I have spent, 
<BR>Yet no more can be due to mee, 
<BR>Then at the bargaine made was ment, 
<BR>If then thy gift of love were partiall, 
<BR>That some to mee, some should to others fall, 
<BR>   Deare, I shall never have Thee All.<br><BR>
<BR>Or if then thou gavest mee all, 
<BR>All was but All, which thou hadst then, 
<BR>But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall, 
<BR>New love created bee, by other men, 
<BR>Which have their stocks intire, and can in teares, 
<BR>In sighs, in oathes, and letters outbid mee, 
<BR>This new love may beget new feares, 
<BR>For, this love was not vowed by thee, 
<BR>And yet is was, thy gift being generall, 
<BR>The ground, thy heart is mine, what ever shall 
<BR>   Grow there, deare, I should have it all.<br><BR>
<BR>Yet I would not have all yet, 
<BR>Hee that hath all can have no more, 
<BR>And since my love doth every day admit 
<BR>New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store, 
<BR>Thou canst not every day give me thy heart, 
<BR>If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it: 
<BR>Loves riddles are, that though thy heart depart, 
<BR>It stayes at home, and thou with losing savest it: 
<BR>But wee will have a way more liberall, 
<BR>Then changing hearts, to joyne them, so wee shall 
<BR>   Be one, and one anothers All.<br><BR>
<p><strong>The Extasie</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR> 
<BR>Where,like a pillow on a bed, 
<BR>   A Pregnant banke swel'd up, to rest 
<BR>The violets reclining head, 
<BR>   Sat we two, one anothers best; 
<BR>Our hands were firmely cimented 
<BR>With a fast balme, which thence did spring, 
<BR>Our eye-beames twisted, and did thred 
<BR>   Our eyes, upon one double string, 
<BR>So to'entergraft our hands, as yet 
<BR>   Was all the meanes to make us one, 
<BR>And pictures in our eyes to get 
<BR>   Was all our propagation. 
<BR>As'twixt two equall Armies, Fate 
<BR>   Suspends uncertaine victorie, 
<BR>Our soules, (which to advance their state, 
<BR>   Were gone out,) hung 'twixt her, and mee. 
<BR>And whil'st our soules negotiate there, 
<BR>   Wee like sepulchrall statues lay, 
<BR>All day, the same our postures were, 
<BR>   And wee said nothing, all the day. 
<BR>If any, so by love refin'd, 
<BR>   That he soules language understood, 
<BR>And by good love were growen all minde, 
<BR>   Within convenient distance stood, 
<BR>He (though he knowes not which soule spake, 
<BR>   Because both meant, both spake the same) 
<BR>Might thence a new concoction take, 
<BR>   And part farre purer then he came. 
<BR>This Extasie doth unperplex 
<BR>   (We said) and tell us what we love, 
<BR>Wee see by this, it was not sexe 
<BR>   Wee see, we saw not what did move: 
<BR>But as all severall soules containe 
<BR>   Mixture of things, they know not what, 
<BR>Love, these mixt soules, doth mixe againe, 
<BR>   And makes both one, each this and that. 
<BR>A single violet transplant, 
<BR>   The strength, the colour, and the size, 
<BR>(All which before was poore, and scant,) 
<BR>   Redoubles still, and multiplies. 
<BR>When love, with one another so 
<BR>   Interanimates two soules, 
<BR>That abler soule, which thence doth flow, 
<BR>   Defects of lonelinesse controules. 
<BR>Wee then, who are this new soule, know, 
<BR>   Of what we are compos'd, and made, 
<BR>For, th'Atomies of which we grow, 
<BR>   Are soules, whom no change can invade. 
<BR>But O alas, so long, so farre 
<BR>   Our bodies why doe wee forbeare? 
<BR>They are ours, though not wee, Wee are 
<BR>   The intelligences, they the spheares. 
<BR>We owe them thankes, because they thus, 
<BR>   Did us, to us, at first convay, 
<BR>Yeelded their senses force to us, 
<BR>   Nor are drosse to us, but allay. 
<BR>On man heavens influence workes not so, 
<BR>   But that it first imprints the ayre, 
<BR>For soule into the soule may flow, 
<BR>   Though it to body first repaire. 
<BR>As our blood labours to beget 
<BR>   Spirits, as like soules as it can, 
<BR>Because such fingers need to knit 
<BR>   That subtile knot, which makes us man: 
<BR>So must pure lovers soules descend 
<BR>   T'affections, and to faculties, 
<BR>Which sense may reach and apprehend, 
<BR>   Else a great Prince in prison lies, 
<BR>To'our bodies turne wee then, that so 
<BR>   Weake men on love reveal'd may looke; 
<BR>Loves mysteries in soules doe grow, 
<BR>   But yet the body is his booke. 
<BR>And if some lover, such as wee, 
<BR>   Have heard this dialogue of one, 
<BR>Let him still marke us, he shall see 
<BR>   Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.<br><BR>
<p><strong>Love's Deitie</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR> 
<BR>I long to talke with some old lovers ghost, 
<BR>   Who dyed before the god of Love was borne: 
<BR>I cannot thinke that hee, who then lov'd most, 
<BR>   Sunke so low, as to love one which did scorne. 
<BR>But since this god produc'd a destinie, 
<BR>And that vice-nature, custome, lets it be; 
<BR>   I must love her, that loves not mee.<br><BR>
<BR>Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much: 
<BR>   Nor he, in his young godhead practis'd it. 
<BR>But when an even flame two hearts did touch, 
<BR>   His office was indulgently to fit 
<BR>Actives to passives. Correspondencie 
<BR>Only his subject was; It cannot bee 
<BR>   Love, till I love her, that loves mee.<br><BR>
<BR>But every moderne god will now extend 
<BR>   His vast prerogative, as far as Jove. 
<BR>To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend, 
<BR>   All is the purlewe of the God of Love. 
<BR>Oh were wee wak'ned by this Tyrannie 
<BR>To ungod this child againe, it could not beo 
<BR>   I should love her, who loves not mee.<br><BR>
<BR>Rebell and Atheist too, why murmure I, 
<BR>   As though I felt the worst that love could doe? 
<BR>Love may make me leave loving, or might trie 
<BR>   A deeper plague, to make her love mee too, 
<BR>Which since she loves before, I'am loth to see; 
<BR>Falshood is worse then hate; and that must bee, 
<BR>   If shee whom I love, should love mee.<br><BR>
<p><strong>Love's Alchemy</strong><BR><em>John Donne</em>
<BR> 
<BR>Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I, 
<BR>Say, where his centric happiness doth lie; 
<BR>     I have lov'd, and got, and told, 
<BR>But should I love, get, tell, till I were old, 
<BR>I should not find that hidden mystery. 
<BR>     Oh, 'tis imposture all! 
<BR>And as no chemic yet th'elixir got, 
<BR>     But glorifies his pregnant pot 
<BR>     If by the way to him befall 
<BR>Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal, 
<BR>     So, lovers dream a rich and long delight, 
<BR>     But get a winter-seeming summer's night.<br><BR>
<BR>Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day, 
<BR>Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay? 
<BR>     Ends love in this, that my man 
<BR>Can be as happy'as I can, if he can 
<BR>Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play? 
<BR>     That loving wretch that swears 
<BR>'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds, 
<BR>     Which he in her angelic finds, 
<BR>     Would swear as justly that he hears, 
<BR>In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres. 
<BR>     Hope not for mind in women; at their best 
<BR>     Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.<br><BR>

<h1>Pablo Neruda</h1>
<strong>Morning XXVII</strong><BR><em>Pablo Neruda</em>
<BR> 
<BR> Naked, you are simple as one of your hands,
<BR> smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round:
<BR> you have moon-lines, apple-pathways:
<BR> naked, you are slender as a naked grain of wheat.<br><BR> 
<BR> Naked, you are blue as a night in Cuba;
<BR> you have vines and stars in your hair;
<BR> naked you are spacious and yellow
<BR> as summer in a golden church.<br><BR> 
<BR> Naked, you are tiny as one of your nails --
<BR> curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born
<BR> and you withdraw to the underground world,<br><BR> 
<BR> as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores:
<BR> your clear light dims, gets dressed -- drops its leaves --
<BR> and becomes a naked hand again.
<BR> 
<p><strong>Lithe girl, brown girl</strong><BR><em>Pablo Neruda, trans. Christopher Logue</em>
<BR>
<BR>Lithe girl, brown girl,<br><BR>
<BR>The sun that makes apples,
<BR>And stiffens the wheat,
<BR>And splits the thong weed,<br><BR>Made your body with joy.<br><BR>Your tongue like a red bird
<BR>Dancing on ivory,
<BR>Your lips with the smile of water.<br><BR>You stretch your arms<br><BR>And the sun grabs
<BR>At the loose black coils
<BR>Of your hair<br><BR>As if water were falling.<br><BR>Tantalize the sun, if you dare,
<BR>It will leave
<BR>Shadows that match you everywhere.<br><BR>Lithe girl, brown girl,<br><BR>Nothing draws me towards you,
<BR>And the heat within you
<BR>Beats me home<br><BR>Like the sun at high noon.<br><BR>Knowing these things,
<BR>Perhaps through knowing these things,
<BR>I seek you out,
<BR>Listening for your voice or the brush<br><BR>Of your arms against wheat,
<BR>Or your step
<BR>Among poppies grown under water.
<BR>
<p><strong>Clenched Soul</strong><BR><em>Pablo Neruda</em>
<BR>
<BR> We have lost even this twilight.
<BR> No one saw us this evening hand in hand
<BR> while the blue night dropped on the world.<br><BR>
<BR> I have seen from my window
<BR> the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.<br><BR>
<BR> Sometimes a piece of sun 
<BR> burned like a coin in my hand.<br><BR>
<BR> I remembered you with my soul clenched
<BR> in that sadness of mine that you know.<br><BR>
<BR> Where were you then?
<BR> Who else was there?
<BR> Saying what?
<BR> Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly
<BR> when I am sad and feel you are far away?<br><BR>
<BR> The book fell that always closed at twilight
<BR> and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet.<br><BR>
<BR> Always, always you recede through the evenings
<BR> toward the twilight erasing statues.
<BR>
<p><strong>Love Sonnet XI</strong><BR><em>Pablo Neruda</em>
<BR>
<BR> I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.
<BR> Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets.
<BR> Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
<BR> I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.<br><BR> 
<BR> I hunger for your sleek laugh,
<BR> your hands the color of a savage harvest,
<BR> hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
<BR> I want to eat your skin like a whole almond.<br><BR> 
<BR> I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
<BR> the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
<BR> I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,<br><BR> 
<BR> and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
<BR> hunting for you, for your hot heart,
<BR> like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue.

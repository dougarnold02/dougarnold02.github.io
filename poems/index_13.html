<strong>Menelaus and Helen</strong><BR><em>Rupert Brooke</em>
<BR>
<BR><div align="center">I</div>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke
<BR>&nbsp;To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate
<BR>&nbsp;On that adulterous whore a ten years' hate
<BR>And a king's honour. Through red death, and smoke,
<BR>And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,
<BR>&nbsp;Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.
<BR>&nbsp;He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim
<BR>Luxurious bower, flaming like a god. <br><BR>
<BR>High sat white Helen, lonely and serene.
<BR>&nbsp;He had not remembered that she was so fair,
<BR>And that her neck curved down in such a way;
<BR>And he felt tired. He flung the sword away,
<BR>&nbsp;And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,
<BR>The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen. <br><BR>
<BR>
<BR><div align="center">II</div>
<BR>
<BR>So far the poet. How should he behold
<BR>&nbsp;That journey home, the long connubial years?
<BR>&nbsp;He does not tell you how white Helen bears
<BR>Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,
<BR>Haggard with virtue. Menelaus bold
<BR>&nbsp;Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys
<BR>&nbsp;'Twixt noon and supper. And her golden voice
<BR>Got shrill as he grew deafer. And both were old. <br><BR>
<BR>Often he wonders why on earth he went
<BR>&nbsp;Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came.
<BR>Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;
<BR>&nbsp;Her dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.
<BR>So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
<BR>And Paris slept on by Scamander side. 
<BR>
<p><strong>Adam's Complaint</strong><BR><em>Denise Levertov</em>
<BR> Some people,
<BR> no matter what you give them,
<BR> still want the moon.<br><BR>
<BR> The bread,
<BR> the salt,
<BR> white meat and dark,
<BR> still hungry.<br><BR>
<BR> The marriage bed
<BR> and the cradle,
<BR> still empty arms.<br><BR>
<BR> You give them land,
<BR> their own earth under their feet,
<BR> still they take to the roads.<br><BR>
<BR> And water: dig them the deepest well,
<BR> still it's not deep enough
<BR> to drink the moon from.
<BR>
<p><p><strong>Named</strong><BR><em>Stephen Dunn</em>
<BR>He'd spent his life trying to control the names people gave him;
<BR>oh the unfair and the accurate equally hurt.<br><BR>
<BR>Just recently he'd been a son-of-a-bitch and sweetheart in the same day,
<BR>and once again knew what antonyms<br><BR>
<BR>love and control are, and how comforting it must be to have a business card --
<BR>Manager, Specialist -- and believe what it says.<br><BR>
<BR>Who, in fact, didn't want his most useful name to enter with him,
<BR>when he entered a room, who didn't want to be<br><BR>
<BR>that kind of lie? A man who was a sweetheart and a son-of-a-bitch
<BR>was also more or less every name<br><BR>
<BR>he'd ever been called, and when you die, he thought, that's when it happens,
<BR>you're collected forever into a few small words.<br><BR>
<BR>But never to have been outrageous or exquisite, no grand mistake
<BR>so utterly yours it causes whispers<br><BR>
<BR>in the peripheries of your presence -- that was his fear.
<BR>"Reckless"; he wouldn't object to such a name<br><BR>
<BR>if it came from the right voice with the right amount of reverence.
<BR>Someone nearby, of course, certain to add "fool." 
<BR>
<p><strong>The Leaden-Eyed</strong><BR><em>Vachel Lindsay</em>
<BR> Let not young souls be smothered out before
<BR> They do quaint deeds and fully flaunt their pride.
<BR> It is the world's one crime its babes grow dull,
<BR> Its poor are ox-like, limp and leaden-eyed.<br><BR>
<BR> Not that they starve, but starve so dreamlessly;
<BR> Not that they sow, but that they seldom reap;
<BR> Not that they serve, but have no gods to serve;
<BR> Not that they die, but that they die like sheep.
<BR>
<p><strong>The More you have to loose</strong><BR><em>David Lehman</em>
<BR>
<BR>Time lies, and a year can go by in a day
<BR>Look at your watch. Do your eyes say 2.45 or 9.15?
<BR>The more you have, the more you can give away.<br><BR>
<BR>Your know the feeling, having no money, having to stay
<BR>With relatives when you travel, unable to say what you mean:
<BR>Time lies, and a year can go by in a day.<br><BR>
<BR>When my father turned into my son, like a play,
<BR>All the fun took place off-stage. What about the missing queen?
<BR>The more you have, the more you can give away.<br><BR>
<BR>The less you believe, the more you wish you could pray.
<BR>Like a clock without hands, the truth of a face remains unseen.
<BR>Time lies, and a year can go by in a day.<br><BR>
<BR>With an elbow on the counter, and no passions left to sway,
<BR>The all-night waitress smokes butt after butt, coughing in-between: 
<BR>The more you have, the more you can throw away.<br><BR>
<BR>Ocean, what is on the other side of all that blue and grey?
<BR>What does the grass know of yesterday's vanished green?
<BR>Time lies, and a year can go by in a day.
<BR>The more you have, the more you can give away.
<BR>
<p><strong>Je souhaite dans ma maison</strong><BR><em>Apollinaire</em>
<BR>Je souhaite dans ma maison
<BR>Une jeunne fille ayant sa raison
<BR>Un chat passant parmi les livres
<BR>Des amis en tout saison
<BR>Sans lesquels je ne peux pas vivre
<BR>
<p><strong>Black Rook in Rainy Weather</strong><BR><em>Sylvia Plath</em>
<BR>
<BR> On the stiff twig up there 
<BR> Hunches a wet black rook
<BR> Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain-
<BR> I do not expect a miracle
<BR> Or an accident<br><BR>
<BR> To set the sight on fire
<BR> In my eye, nor seek
<BR> Any more in the desultory weather some design,
<BR> But let spotted leaves fall as they fall
<BR> Without ceremony, or portent.<br><BR>
<BR> Although, I admit, I desire,
<BR> Occasionally, some backtalk
<BR> From the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:
<BR> A certain minor light may still 
<BR> Lean incandescent<br><BR>
<BR> Out of kitchen table or chair
<BR> As if a celestial burning took
<BR> Possession of the most obtuse objects now and then -
<BR> Thus hallowing an interval
<BR> Otherwise inconsequent <br><BR>
<BR> By bestowing largesse, honor
<BR> One might say love. At any rate, I now walk
<BR> Wary (for it could happen
<BR> Even in this dull, ruinous landscape); sceptical
<BR> Yet politic, ignorant<br><BR>
<BR> Of whatever angel any choose to flare
<BR> Suddenly at my elbow. I only know that a rook
<BR> Ordering its black feathers can so shine
<BR> As to seize my senses, haul 
<BR> My eyelids up, and grant <br><BR>
<BR> A brief respite from fear
<BR> Of total neutrality. With luck,
<BR> Trekking stubborn through this season
<BR> Of fatigue, I shall 
<BR> Patch together a content<br><BR>
<BR> Of sorts. Miracles occur.
<BR> If you care to call those spasmodic
<BR> Tricks of radiance
<BR> Miracles. The wait's begun again,
<BR> The long wait for the angel,<br><BR>
<BR> For that rare, random descent.
<BR>
<p><strong>Portrait of a Schoolmaster</strong><BR><em>Peter Levi</em>
<BR>
<BR>And I should wish to draw you, caught so
<BR>head on one side, hand on the tea-table
<BR>that nervous posture and those eyes able
<BR>to relax in accuracy at a window,<br><BR>
<BR>in a view of hills reclined distantly,
<BR>olive coloured and tall, or like clear
<BR>Latin speech, weighed and fine in the ear,
<BR>designed by ice, or tortuous irony;<br><BR>
<BR>or else exhaling aphorisms like brittle
<BR>fire or a nineteenth century rocket,
<BR>-- by fascination seeming to forget
<BR>what this lights up so briefly and so little:<br><BR>
<BR>the mildewed landscape which no mind can cure,
<BR>hypocrisy of the hearts incompetence,
<BR>all the sad images of violence
<BR>and decorous religions of failure.<br><BR>
<BR>(This poem may be about Frederick Turner (1910-2000), a teacher at Stoneyhurst College.)
<BR>
<p><strong>Concerto for Double Bass</strong><BR><em>John Fuller</em>
<BR>
<BR> He is a drunk leaning companionably
<BR> Around a lamp post or doing up
<BR> With intermittent concentration
<BR> Another drunk's coat.<br><BR>
<BR> He is a polite but devoted Valentino,
<BR> Cheek to cheek, forgetting the next step.
<BR> He is feeling the pulse of the fat lady
<BR> Or cutting her in half.<br><BR> 
<BR> But close your eyes and it is sunset
<BR> At the edge of the world. It is the language
<BR> Of dolphins, the growth of tree-roots,
<BR> The heart-beat slowing down.<br><BR>
<BR>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong><BR><em>Carol Ann Duffy</em>
<BR> 
<BR> Some days, although we cannot pray, a prayer
<BR> utters itself. So, a woman will lift
<BR> her head from the sieve of her hands and stare
<BR> at the minims sung by a tree, a sudden gift.<br><BR> 
<BR> Some nights, although we are faithless, the truth
<BR> enters our hearts, that small familiar pain;
<BR> then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youth
<BR> in the distant Latin chanting of a train.<br><BR> 
<BR> Pray for us now. Grade 1 piano scales
<BR> console the lodger looking out across
<BR> a Midlands town. Then dusk, and someone calls
<BR> a child's name as though they named their loss.<br><BR> 
<BR> Darkness outside. Inside, the radio's prayer --
<BR> Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre.<br><BR>
<p><strong>Epitaph for Francis Chartres (1669-1731)</strong><BR><em>Dr. Arbuthnot<br>(The London Magazine, 1732)</em>
<BR>
<BR>HERE continueth to rot
<BR> The body of FRANCIS CHARTRES
<BR> Who with an INFLEXIBLE CONSTANCY
<BR>&nbsp;and INIMITABLE UNIFORMITY of Life  PERSISTED
<BR> In spite of AGE and INFIRMITIES,
<BR> In the practice of EVERY HUMAN VICE;
<BR> Excepting PRODIGIALITY and HYPOCRISY:
<BR> His insatiable AVARICE exempted him from the first,
<BR> His matchless IMPUDENCE from the second.<br><BR>&nbsp;Nor was he more singular
<BR> In the undeviating <em>pravity</em> of his <em>Manners</em>,
<BR> Than successful
<BR> In <em>accumulating</em> wealth,
<BR> For without TRADE or PROFESSION,
<BR> Without TRUST of PUBLIC MONEY,
<BR> And without BRIBE-WORTHY Service,
<BR> He acquired, or more properly created,
<BR> A MINISTERIAL ESTATE.<br><BR>&nbsp;He was the only Person of his Time,
<BR> Who could cheat without the Mask of HONESTY,
<BR> Retain his Primeval MEANNESS
<BR> When possess'd of TEN THOUSAND a Year,
<BR> And having daily deserved the Gibbet for what he <em>did</em>,
<BR> Was at last condemned to it for what he <em>could</em> not <em>do</em>.<br><BR>&nbsp;Oh Indignant Reader!
<BR> Think not his life useless to Mankind!
<BR> Providence conniv'd at his execrable Designs,
<BR> To give to After-ages
<BR> A conspicuous PROOF and EXAMPLE,
<BR> Of how small Estimation is EXORBITANT WEALTH in the sight of God,
<BR> By bestowing it on the most UNWORTHY of ALL MORTALS.
<BR>
<p><strong>Untitled</strong><BR><em>Issa</em>
<BR>  What good luck!
<BR>  Bitten by
<BR>  This year's mosquitoes too.
<BR>
<p><strong>Adlestrop</strong><BR><em>Edward Thomas</em>
<BR> Yes, I remember Adlestrop -
<BR> The name, because one afternoon
<BR> Of heat the express-train drew up there
<BR> Unwontedly. It was late June. <br><BR>
<BR> The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
<BR> No one left and no one came
<BR> On the bare platform. What I saw
<BR> Was Adlestrop - only the name <br><BR>
<BR> And willows, willow-herb, and grass,
<BR> And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,
<BR> No whit less still and lonely fair
<BR> Than the high cloudlets in the sky.<br><BR>
<BR> And for that minute a blackbird sang
<BR> Close by, and round him, mistier,
<BR> Farther and farther, all the birds
<BR> Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.
<BR>
<p><strong>Bearhug</strong><BR><em>Michael Ondaatje</em>
<BR> Griffin calls to come and kiss him goodnight
<BR> I yell ok. Finish something I'm doing,
<BR> then something else, walk slowly round
<BR> the corner to my son's room.
<BR> He is standing arms outstretched
<BR> waiting for a bearhug. Grinning.<br><BR> 
<BR> Why do I give my emotion an animal's name,
<BR> give it that dark squeeze of death?
<BR> This is the hug which collects
<BR> all his small bones and his warm neck against me.
<BR> The thin tough body under the pyjamas
<BR> locks to me like a magnet of blood.<br><BR> 
<BR> How long was he standing there
<BR> like that, before I came?
<BR>
<p><strong>Strugnell's Sonnets (VI)</strong><BR><em>Wendy Cope</em>
<BR>
<BR> Let me not to the marriage of true swine
<BR> Admit impediments. With his big car
<BR> He's won your heart, and you have punctured mine. 
<BR> I have no spare; henceforth I'll bear the scar.
<BR> Since women are not worth the booze you buy them
<BR> I dedicate myself to Higher Things. 
<BR> If men deride and sneer, I shall defy them
<BR> And soar above Tulse Hill on poet's wings - 
<BR> A brother to the thrush in Brockwell Park,
<BR> Whose song, though sometimes drowned by rock guitars,
<BR> Outlives their din. One day I'll make my mark,
<BR> Although I'm not from Ulster or from Mars,
<BR> And when I'm published in some classy mag
<BR> You'll rue the day you scarpered in his Jag.
<BR>
<p><strong>Keith Chegwin as Fleance</strong><BR><em>Paul Farley</em>
<BR>The next rung up from extra and dogsbody
<BR>and all the cliches are true -- days waiting for 
<BR>enough light, learning card games, penny-ante,
<BR> while fog rolls off the sea, a camera 
<BR>gets moisture in its gate, and Roman Polanski 
<BR>curses the day he chose Snowdonia.<br><BR>
<BR>He picked you for your hair to play this role:
<BR> a look had reached Bootle from Altamont 
<BR>that year. You wouldn't say you sold your soul 
<BR>but learned your line inside a beating tent 
<BR>by candlelight, the shingle dark as coal
<BR> behind each wave, and its slight restatement.<br><BR>
<BR>"A tale told by an idiot..." "Not your turn, 
<BR>but perhaps, with time and practice...", the Pole starts. 
<BR>Who's to say, behind the accent and that grin, 
<BR>what designs you had on playing a greater part? 
<BR>The crew get ready while the stars go in. 
<BR>You speak the words you'd written on your heart<br><BR>
<BR>just as the long-awaited sunrise fires 
<BR>the sky a blueish pink. Who could have seen 
<BR>this future in the late schedules, where I 
<BR>can't sleep, and watch your flight from the big screen; 
<BR>on the other side of drink and wondering why,
<BR>the zany, household-name years in between?
<BR>
<p><strong>They Flee From Me</strong><BR><em>Thomas Wyatt</em>
<BR>
<BR>They flee from me that sometime did me seek
<BR>With naked foot stalking in my chamber.
<BR>I have seen them gentle tame and meek
<BR>That now are wild and do not remember
<BR>That sometime they put themselves in danger
<BR>To take bread at my hand; and now they range
<BR>Busily seeking with a continual change.
<BR>
<BR>Thanked be fortune, it hath been otherwise
<BR>Twenty times better; but once in special,
<BR>In thin array after a pleasant guise,
<BR>When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
<BR>And she me caught in her arms long and small;
<BR>And therewithal sweetly did me kiss,
<BR>And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?
<BR>
<BR>It was no dream, I lay broad waking.
<BR>But all is turned thorough my gentleness
<BR>Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
<BR>And I have leave to go of her goodness
<BR>And she also to use newfangleness.
<BR>But since that I so kindely am served,
<BR>I would fain know what she hath deserved.
<BR>
<p><strong>The South Country</strong><BR><em>Hilaire Belloc</em>
<BR>
<BR>When I am living in the Midlands
<BR>That are sodden and unkind,
<BR>I light my lamp in the evening:
<BR>My work is left behind;
<BR>And the great hills of the South Country
<BR>Come back into my mind.<br><BR>
<BR>The great hills of the South Country
<BR>They stand along the sea;
<BR>And it's there walking in the high woods
<BR>That I could wish to be,
<BR>And the men that were boys when I was a boy
<BR>Walking along with me.<br><BR>
<BR>The men that live in North England
<BR>I saw them for a day:
<BR>Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,
<BR>Their skies are fast and grey;
<BR>From their castle-walls a man may see
<BR>The mountains far away.<br><BR>
<BR>The men that live in West England
<BR>They see the Severn strong,
<BR>A-rolling on rough water brown
<BR>Light aspen leaves along.
<BR>They have the secret of the Rocks,
<BR>And the oldest kind of song.<br><BR>
<BR>But the men that live in the South Country
<BR>Are the kindest and most wise,
<BR>They get their laughter from the loud surf,
<BR>And the faith in their happy eyes
<BR>Comes surely from our Sister the Spring
<BR>When over the sea she flies;
<BR>The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,
<BR>She blesses us with surprise.<br><BR>
<BR>I never get between the pines
<BR>But I smell the Sussex air;
<BR>Nor I never come on a belt of sand
<BR>But my home is there.
<BR>And along the sky the line of the Downs
<BR>So noble and so bare.<br><BR>
<BR>A lost thing could I never find,
<BR>Nor a broken thing mend:
<BR>And I fear I shall be all alone
<BR>When I get towards the end.
<BR>Who will there be to comfort me
<BR>Or who will be my friend?<br><BR>
<BR>I will gather and carefully make my friends
<BR>Of the men of the Sussex Weald;
<BR>They watch the stars from silent folds,
<BR>They stiffly plough the field.
<BR>By them and the God of the South Country
<BR>My poor soul shall be healed.<br><BR>
<BR>If I ever become a rich man,
<BR>Or if ever I grow to be old,
<BR>I will build a house with deep thatch
<BR>To shelter me from the cold,
<BR>And there shall the Sussex songs be sung
<BR>And the story of Sussex told.<br><BR>
<BR>I will hold my house in the high wood
<BR>Within a walk of the sea,
<BR>And the men that were boys when I was a boy
<BR>Shall sit and drink with me.<br><BR>

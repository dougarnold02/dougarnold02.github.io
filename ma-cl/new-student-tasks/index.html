    <p>The idea of these tasks is to get you familiar with a few things you will need to be
familiar with (e.g. the computing labs, the library, etc. etc). They are not to be
taken too seriously, but doing them will be useful.
<ol><li>find all the computer labs mentioned on the timetable, in each one
  log on to a computer, start up a web browser, and find this page (You can
  get to it from my home page, which you will have to find for yourself).
<li>Send me (<a HREF="mailto:doug@essex.ac.uk"><tt>doug@essex.ac.uk</tt></a>) an email containing the text in this page (don't
      re-type it; don't bother too much about the format)
<li>Do a web search for the following:
<ul><li>Computational Linguistics
<li>LFG
<li>Constraint Based Grammar
<li>Parsing
<li>Prolog Natural Language
</ul>
<li>Locate the following paper on the Web: 
     Dalrymple, Mary. 2006. 'Lexical Functional Grammar'. In Keith Brown
     (eds), Encyclopedia of language and linguistics (2nd edition). Oxford:
     Elsevier. (Of course, it can also be found in the library).
<li>Find the name of a computational linguistics conference.
<li>Print this page.
<li>What is the most recent edition of the <em>Computational Linguistics</em> in the
      library? What is the first?
<li>What floor(s) are the books about Prolog on?
</ol>

<h4><A NAME="1"><b>What is the typical profile of students on the MA in CL?</b></a></h4>

<p>  I don't think there is one, really, but there are some tendencies. We require
  students to have a good background in Linguistics, or Computer Science, or a
  related discipline (such as Psychology).  Most students have more background in
  Linguistics than in computation -- relatively few have a strong background in
  programming (though there are exceptions).
<h4><A NAME="2"><b>What are the job prospects for a graduate of the MA in CL?</b></a></h4>

<p> The demand for people with a CL background is very considerable, and the prospects
 are very good.
<p> Students who do well on the course have an excellent chance of getting a job or a
 research position (including a PhD place) in Computational Linguistics, providing
 they are prepared to travel. A glance at <a HREF="../alumnus-page/">the Alumnus Page</a> 
 will show that there are graduates of the course all over Europe doing PhDs, working
 for `Language Engineering' companies, teaching in Universities. 
<p> Of course, the same page will also show that there are others who go back home and
 do essentially what they were doing before, and many who drop out of touch quite
 quickly.  
<p> You can get an idea of the sorts of jobs that are available to someone with a
 background in Computational Linguistics from several sites, for example:
<ul><li><a HREF="http://www.elsnet.org/jobs/"><tt>http://www.elsnet.org/jobs/</tt></a>
</ul>
<h4><A NAME="3"><b>How can I get a better idea of what is involved in the course?</b></a></h4>

  You could try having a look at some of the course material. See:
<p><a HREF="http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/research/resgroups/clgroup/GradProg/CourseWareSamples/"><tt>http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/research/resgroups/clgroup/GradProg/CourseWareSamples/</tt></a>

<h4><A NAME="4"><b>What about funding?</b></a></h4>

  You can find some information about funding (grants and so on) at 
  <a HREF="http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/prospective_students/funding.aspx">http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/prospective_students/funding.aspx</a>
<h4><A NAME="5"><b>Is there anything I can read before the start of the course?</b></a></h4>

Yes. Here is <a HREF="../pre-reading/">a list of books you could try</a>.

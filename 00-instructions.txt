Edit: use emacs on index.tex
To add a bib entry:
   - edit the relevant bit of index.tex, adding the citation key
   - if the entry's citation key is Arnold2020xxx, then make sure it is in the
     Arnold-major.bib or Arnold-minor.bib
   - make sure the bib entry contains a url field (if you want the paper to be downloadable)
   - add the entry in a single file to bib/Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt:
     - cd bib
     - make Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt
     - make all
     - cd -
   - now run 
     - make latex  (this will set things up for the run of make bib)
     - make bib
     - make
     - make view
   - if you do not have privatewww directly mounted, then do 
     - make sync-put
   - if you mess things up, you will need to:
     - remove the index.bbl (by hand) [because this is where the text comes from]
     - go back to the start, and maybe: make -W index.tex all
   - update:
     - research gate and
     - academia.edu
     - eprint archive at Essex

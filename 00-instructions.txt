- Edit: use emacs on index.tex
- use hyperlatex-format-buffer to update the html
- The webpage now lives on github, so you need to do various things to export the html to
  the git repository. See https://cli.github.com/manual/
  (This is for the command line interface. There is also a GUI: github-desktop.app.
  - check authorisation:
    - gh auth status
  - login to the git repository (and follow the instructions):
    - gh auth login
      you get prompted -- just follow the instructions
  - see what you have in the repository:
    - gh browse
      (this opens https://github.com/dougarnold02/dougarnold02.github.io)
  - when finished:
    - gh auth logout
  - then you use `git' commands to interact with the repository :
    - git status
      to see how things stand
    - git push
      to push changes to the repository
    - git add
      to add a file to the list of files to be tracked ('git add .' will add the whole directory)
- To add a bib entry:
   - edit the relevant bit of index.tex, adding the citation key
   - if the entry's citation key is Arnold2020xxx, then make sure it is in the
     Arnold-major.bib or Arnold-minor.bib
   - make sure the bib entry contains a url field (if you want the paper to be downloadable)
   - add the entry in a single file to bib/Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt:
     - cd bib
     - make Arnold2020xxx-bib.txt
     - make all
     - cd -
   - now run 
     - make latex  (this will set things up for the run of make bib)
     - make bib
     - make
     - make view
   - if you do not have privatewww directly mounted, then do 
     - make sync-put
   - if you mess things up, you will need to:
     - remove the index.bbl (by hand) [because this is where the text comes from]
     - go back to the start, and maybe: make -W index.tex all
   - update:
     - research gate and
     - academia.edu
     - eprint archive at Essex
